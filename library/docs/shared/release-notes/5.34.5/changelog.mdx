## Page Builder

### Form Page Element - Resolved A Form Submission Issue ([#3034](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3034))

We've addressed an issue related to the Form page element. Essentially, the issue was preventing users from submitting the form on a public website.

## Development

### Babel Plugin Lodash ([#3045](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3045))

We've added a piece of code in our [createBabelConfigForNode.js](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/20c3b650e48b756e98ed74f75a9e41919e8afed2/packages/project-utils/packages/createBabelConfigForNode.js) due to a change in the @babel/types causing babel-plugin-lodash to break on build time.
