<Alert type="danger" title="Deprecation of lifecycle events created before 5.33.0">
In the 5.33.0 we changed the property names which define the lifecycle events in the Headless CMS.
Old ones are still available, but are marked as deprecated. They will be removed in 5.35.0.
</Alert>

<Alert type="success" title="What you'll learn">

- what are lifecycle events

<Alert type="info">

Lifecycle events using publish/subscribe pattern replace the hook plugins starting from version 5.18.0.

</Alert>

## Overview

In our Headless CMS we provide lifecycle events available for you to hook into.

With the lifecycle events you can hook into a number of different operations.

For example, when using [DynamoDB + Elasticsearch](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/api-headless-cms-ddb-es/src/index.ts#L111) as storage layer, we use the `onSystemBeforeInstall` to insert the template for Elasticsearch index.

## System

### onSystemBeforeInstall

This event is triggered before the installation of the Headless CMS and insertion of initial "Ungrouped" group.

#### How to subscribe to this event?

```typescript
new ContextPlugin<CmsContext>(async context => {
  context.cms.onSystemBeforeInstall.subscribe(async ({ tenant }) => {
    await notifyAnotherSystemThatHeadlessCmsIsGettingInstalled({ tenant });
  });
});
```

### onSystemAfterInstall

This event is triggered after the installation of the Headless CMS.

```

<Alert type="info">

Please note that in between `onSystemBeforeInstall` and `onSystemAfterInstall` we create a default CmsGroup named "Ungrouped" and, because of that, there are events `onGroupBeforeCreate` and `onGroupAfterCreate` being run.

## Entry

<Alert type="info">

Note that `storageEntry`, `originalStorageEntry`, `latestStorageEntry` and `publishedStorageEntry` are objects derived from the `entry` object which we want to store into the database.

## Registering Lifecycle Event Subscriptions

### System Lifecycle Events

For the subscriptions (your code) to be run, you must register it in the `createHandler` in the `api/code/graphql/src/index.ts` file.

```typescript api/code/graphql/src/index.ts
const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    // ... rest of plugins
    new ContextPlugin<PbContext>(async context => {
      /**
       * There is no context.cms on options request, so we skip adding lifecycle event subscription.
       */
      if (!context.cms) {
        return;
      }
      context.cms.onSystemBeforeInstall.subscribe(async ({ system }) => {
        // do your magic here
      });
    })
  ]
});
```

### Group, Model And Entries Lifecycle Events

For the subscriptions (your code) to be run, you must register it in the `createHandler` in the `api/code/headlessCMS/src/index.ts` file.

```typescript api/code/headlessCMS/src/index.ts
const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    // ... rest of plugins
    new ContextPlugin<PbContext>(async context => {
      /**
       * There is no context.cms on options request, so we skip adding lifecycle event subscription.
       */
      if (!context.cms) {
        return;
      }
      context.cms.onEntryBeforeCreate.subscribe(async ({ entry }) => {
        // do your magic here
      });
    })
  ]
});
```

<Alert type="warning">

Please be aware that the order of subscribing does matter: if you want some event subscription to be executed before some other one, add it first.

</Alert>

The check condition for `context.cms` will not be required starting with version 5.22.0.
