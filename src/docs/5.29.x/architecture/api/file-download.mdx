## Diagram

<Alert type="info">

For brevity, the diagram doesn't include network-level cloud infrastructure resources, like region, VPC, availability zones, and so on. Check out the [Deployment Modes](../deployment-modes/introduction) section if you're interested in that aspect of the deployed cloud infrastructure.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

Note that the stateful resources like Amazon S3, Amazon Cognito, Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon ElasticSearch are deployed as part of the [Core] project application(../core/overview). These are still included in the diagram, just so it's more clear to the reader.

## Description

The diagram shows what happens every time a client tries to download a binary file.

The flow consists of the following four steps:

1. The client issues a GET `/download/{file-key}` HTTP request, which reaches the Amazon API Gateway <diagram-letter>B</diagram-letter>, which then invokes the File Manager's Download AWS Lambda function <diagram-letter>C</diagram-letter>.
2. The Download AWS Lambda function extracts the file key from the received HTTP request, and then fetches the file from the S3 bucket <diagram-letter>C</diagram-letter>.
3. As a base64 encoded string, the file is returned to the Amazon API Gateway, which transforms it to an actual binary, and sends it back to the Amazon CloudFront.
4. Amazon CloudFront receives the file, caches it, and sends it back to the client.
