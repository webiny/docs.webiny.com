## Introduction

Starting with the Webiny version 5.31.0, when we added the [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/), users can quite easily add new routes to our existing Lambdas.

Users can add as many routes as they want, with possibility for them to be a `POST`, `GET`, `OPTIONS`, `PUT`, `PATH`, `DELETE` and `HEAD` method routes.

## Adding a Route to the API Gateway

First, we need to add the route to the `API Gateway`.
Without this part, the route will not be known by the `API Gateway` and users will get a `404` response.

```typescript apps/api/webiny.application.ts
import { createApiApp } from "@webiny/serverless-cms-aws";
import { ApiGraphql } from "@webiny/pulumi-aws";

export default createApiApp({
  pulumi: app => {
    const graphQlModule = app.getModule(ApiGraphql);
    // add custom POST route
    graphQlModule.addRoute({
      name: "my-custom-route-post",
      path: "/my-custom-path",
      method: "POST"
    });
    // add custom OPTIONS route
    graphQlModule.addRoute({
      name: "my-custom-route-options",
      path: "/my-custom-path",
      method: "OPTIONS"
    });
  }
});
```

After these changes, feel free to deploy the api part of your project to test if new route is working. Use your favorite HTTP client to test it out.

## Adding a Route to the GraphQL Handler

After you added the route to the `API Gateway`, you can move onto creating a route in our existing GraphQL Lambda handler.

```typescript apps/api/graphql/src/index.ts
// add the import somewhere at the top of the file or update the existing import from @webiny/handler-aws
import { createApiGatewayRoute } from "@webiny/handler-aws";

// existing handler
export const handler = createHandler({
    plugins: [
        // at the end of the plugins array you need to create a new API Gateway route
        createApiGatewayRoute(({ onPost, onOptions, context }) => {
          onPost("/my-custom-path", async (request, reply) => {
              // do something with request
              if (request.body === null) {
                  return reply.send({
                      somethingIsWrong: true
                  });
              }
              return reply.send({
                  output: true,
                  someOtherVariable: "xyz"
              });
          });
          onOptions("/my-custom-path", async (_, reply) => {
              return reply.hijack().send({});
          });
      })
    ]
});
```

In the createApiGatewayRoute method callback, there are multiple properties available:

* `onPost` - register a POST method route
* `onOptions` - register an OPTIONS method route
* `onDelete` - register a DELETE method route
* `onPatch` - register a PATCH method route
* `onGet` - register a GET method route
* `onHead` - register a HEAD method route
* `onPut` - register a PUT method route
* `onAll` - register a route which will catch all the existing methods
* `context` - our Webiny internal context with all our applications attached to it

The [`request`](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Request/) and [`reply`](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Reply/) objects are original ones from the Fastify, so you can look into their documentation about what they contain and what you can use.
