## Deployments

### Improved Creation of the IAM Service-linked Role for the Amazon ElasticSearch Service ([#3500](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3500)) ([#3503](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3503))

We've made a couple of improvements to the internal code that handles the initial creation of the [IAM service-linked role for the Amazon ElasticSearch service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/slr.html).

First, the initial creation of the role would happen with both [database setups](/docs/{exact:5.37.x}/architecture/introduction#different-database-setups) - **Amazon DynamoDB-only** and **Amazon DynamoDB + Amazon ElasticSearch**. From now on, the creation of the IAM role will only happen with the latter database setup.

Second, we've made sure that the creation of the IAM role happens immediately upon deploying the **Core** project application, enabling earlier detection of potential issues. 

<Alert type="info">

  Prior to this release, the creation of the IAM service-linked role would happen upon deploying the **API** project application, which is always deployed after the **Core** project application.

Finally, we've added additional logging to the role creation process, which will help users troubleshoot any issues that might arise.

### Fixed Deployment of the Website App With an Existing VPC ([#3505](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3505)

When deploying a Webiny project into [an existing VPC](/docs/{version}/enterprise/use-existing-amazon-vpc) and with [multi-tenancy](/docs/{version}/enterprise/multi-tenancy) enabled, the deployment of the Website app would fail. More specifically, the deployment of the `website-router-origin-request` Lambda@Edge function would fail, because the underlying code was trying to assign VPC configuration to it, which is not allowed.

This has now been addressed. The `website-router-origin-request` Lambda@Edge function is now deployed without VPC configuration.
