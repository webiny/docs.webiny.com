## Deployments

### Data Migrations

We've made several improvements to our data migration process, which will make it easier for you to migrate your data from one Webiny version to another.

#### ✍️ Improved Logging ([#3508](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3508))

#### Missing `WEBINY_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_LOCALE` Environment Variable Causing Data Migrations to Fail  ([#3507](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3507))

Webiny projects that use the **Amazon DynamoDB + Amazon ElasticSearch** [database setup](/docs/{exact:5.37.x}/architecture/introduction#different-database-setups) rely on the `WEBINY_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_LOCALE` environment variable in order to define names of ElasticSearch indexes Webiny will create and use.

When it comes to data migrations, ideally, they should not be affected by the absence of this environment variable. However, this was not the case, and the migration process would fail if the `WEBINY_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_LOCALE` environment variable was not present.

With this release, we've addressed this issue. The migration process will now work as expected no matter if the `WEBINY_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_LOCALE` environment variable is present or not.


### Improved Creation of the IAM Service-linked Role for the Amazon ElasticSearch Service ([#3500](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3500)) ([#3503](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3503))

We've made a couple of improvements to the internal code that handles the initial creation of the [IAM service-linked role for the Amazon ElasticSearch service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/slr.html).

First, the initial creation of the role would happen with both [database setups](/docs/{exact:5.37.x}/architecture/introduction#different-database-setups) - **Amazon DynamoDB-only** and **Amazon DynamoDB + Amazon ElasticSearch**. From now on, the creation of the IAM role will only happen with the latter database setup.

Second, we've made sure that the creation of the IAM role happens immediately upon deploying the **Core** project application, enabling earlier detection of potential issues. 

<Alert type="info">

  Prior to this release, the creation of the IAM service-linked role would happen upon deploying the **API** project application, which is always deployed after the **Core** project application. 

</Alert>

Finally, we've added additional logging to the role creation process, which will help users troubleshoot any issues that might arise.

### Fixed Deployment of the Website App With an Existing VPC ([#3505](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3505)

When deploying a Webiny project into [an existing VPC](/docs/{version}/enterprise/use-existing-amazon-vpc) and with [multi-tenancy](/docs/{version}/enterprise/multi-tenancy) enabled, the deployment of the Website app would fail. More specifically, the deployment of the `website-router-origin-request` Lambda@Edge function would fail, because the underlying code was trying to assign VPC configuration to it, which is not allowed.

This has now been addressed. The `website-router-origin-request` Lambda@Edge function is now deployed without VPC configuration.
