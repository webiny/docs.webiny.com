## GraphQL

### Number Scalar Transform To Number Or Float ([#2765](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2765))

We have fixed an issue where the `Number` scalar in our `@webiny/handler-graphql` package was producing a `string` instead of `number`.

## Headless CMS

### Initialize Model Mutation ([#2766](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2766))

We added the `initializeModel` GraphQL mutation, which can be hooked into via the `onModelInitialize` lifecycle event.
We had to add this because we needed a way to execute creation of the Elasticsearch index, with custom mappings, on the CMS content models created via the code.

Basically, we add the subscription to the `onModelInitialize` lifecycle event, which creates custom the Elasticsearch index:

```typescript
cms.onModelInitialize.subscribe(async ({ model }) => {
  await createElasticsearchIndex({
    elasticsearch,
    model,
    plugins
  });
});
```

### Elasticsearch Body Modifier Plugin ([#2779](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2779))

The `CmsEntryElasticsearchBodyModifierPlugin` did not have the `where` parameter passed into it, so we added it.
This now allows users to access raw `where` object, received from the GraphQL.
