## Page Builder

### Fixed Deletion and Unpublishing of Pages ([#3438](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3438))

Prior to this release, when deleting a page, it would not be fully deleted. More specifically, despite the fact that the page would not be visible in the Admin app, it would still be visible on the public website.

This has now been addressed. When deleting a page, it will be fully deleted, meaning the page will no longer be visible on the public website.

## Deployments

### Fixed Deployment of Website Application With Existing VPC ([#3456](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3456))

When deploying Webiny into [an existing VPC](/docs/{version}/enterprise/use-existing-amazon-vpc) and with [multi-tenancy](/docs/{version}/enterprise/multi-tenancy) enabled, the deployment of the Website application would fail. More specifically, the deployment of the `website-router-origin-request` Lambda@Edge function would fail, because its IAM role was missing the base [`AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole.html) AWS managed policy attached to it.

This has now been addressed.
