## Page Builder

### Page Elements: A Brand New Page Rendering Engine ([#2898](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2898))

With this release, we are introducing a brand new page rendering engine called **Page Elements**!

With it, we've made a complete overhaul of the way pages created with Webiny's Page Builder application are being rendered.

The results are:

- a drastic reduction of more than **80%** ðŸš€ of the total amount of HTML and CSS that is shipped to your website's visitors
- significant improvements in both objective and perceived performance of your website
- better SEO

When it comes to development, the new rendering engine also brought the following:

- easier development of custom page elements
- minimized the chance of having visual differences when comparing a page rendered in the Page Builder's page editor and on the actual public website
- drastically simplified the application code located in **Website** (`apps/website`) and **Theme** (`apps/theme`) folders

<Alert type="info" title={"Backwards Compatibility"}>

  For new Webiny projects, the new rendering engine will be enabled by default. No extra steps needed.

  For existing projects, users have the option to migrate to the new rendering engine over time, once it's convenient
  for them. Until then, their projects will still use the now *legacy* rendering engine, which we plan to support until the end of June 2022. After that, the legacy rendering engine will be considered deprecated and will receive no further support.

</Alert>

### Rendering Pages In External (non-Webiny) Projects

One of the long-awaited features we've also introduced in this release is the ability to render pages created with Webiny's Page Builder application in external (non-Webiny) projects. For example, you can now render pages in a standalone [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application, with just a couple of initial setup steps.

Be sure to check out the related documentation to learn more.

## Mailer

### Default and Configurable Mailer Transports ([#2698](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2698))

The package `@webiny/api-mailer` was upgraded, so we can now define new transports and configure them more easily.

To learn more about our `@webiny/api-mailer` package, please read this [article](/docs/overview/features/mailer).

### Mailer Transport Admin UI Settings ([#2732](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2732))

To make the configuration of the Mailer transports easier, we added the Mailer Settings in the Admin UI.

## Headless CMS

### Advanced (Conditional AND / OR) Filtering ([#2800](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2800)) ([#2916](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2916))

Users can now run the conditional (`AND` and `OR`) filtering in both DynamoDB and DynamoDB + Elasticsearch systems.

To find out more about the advanced filtering, read this [article](/docs/headless-cms/basics/using-graphql-api-advanced-filtering).

### Nested Object Field Filtering ([#2853](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2853)) ([#2905](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2905))

We added a possibility to filter entries by the values in the nested object field.
It does not matter if it is a multiple values object or just a single one, or how deep the data is nested.

Our only recommendation is not to filter really deeply nested objects in the DynamoDB only systems, as it will get slow.

## Development

### Application Aliases ([#2895](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2895))

With this release, we've introduced a small but neat feature called _application aliases_.

Application aliases make it a bit easier to run often used [Webiny CLI](/docs/{exact:5.34.x}/core-development-concepts/basics/webiny-cli) commands. For example, upon running the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/{exact:5.34.x}/core-development-concepts/basics/project-deployment) command, instead of typing the full path of the application, for example `apps/admin`, you can now just type `admin`:

```bash
# Using full path of the application:
yarn webiny deploy apps/admin --env dev

# Using application alias:
yarn webiny deploy admin --env dev
```

The application aliases can be used with all project applications (**Core**, **API**, **Admin**, **Website**) and are also recognized by all Webiny CLI commands.

### Feature Flags ([#2897](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2897))

Another small but neat feature we've introduced with this release are _feature flags_.

This feature can help developers in turning on and off features that might be still in experimental phase or are not yet ready to hit production.

It all starts in the `webiny.project.ts` file, where you can now assign an object to the new `featureFlags` property, and, in it, have any values that might be important for your application. For example:

```ts webiny.project.ts
// ...

export default {
  template: "@webiny/cwp-template-aws@5.34.0",
  name: "my-webiny-project",
  cli: {
    plugins: [
      // ...
    ]
  },
  // The `featureFlags` property:
  featureFlags: {
    mySimpleFeatureFlag: false,
    myComplexFeatureFlag: { a: 1, b: 2 }
  }
};
```

Once defined, the `featureFlags` object can be easily accessed within both backend and frontend application code:

```ts
import { featureFlags } from "@webiny/feature-flags";

// In your application code, you might have the following check:
if (featureFlags.myComplexFeatureFlag.a === 1) {
  return true;
}

return false;
```

To learn more about feature flags, please visit the related [Feature Flags](#) article.

### Environment Variables via `webiny.project.ts` ([#2896](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2896))

There are a couple of ways environment variables can be defined within your Webiny project. With this release, we've introduced one more that might work for some users in  specific use cases.

From now on, environment variables can also be defined via the `webiny.project.ts` file, via the new `env` property. For example:

```ts webiny.project.ts
// ...

export default {
  template: "@webiny/cwp-template-aws@5.34.0",
  name: "my-webiny-project",
  cli: {
    plugins: [
      // ...
    ]
  },
  // The `featureFlags` property:
  env: {
    WEBINY_MY_ENV_VAR: "xyz",
    REACT_APP_MY_OTHER_ENV_VAR: "abc"
  }
};
```

Note that the `WEBINY_` prefixed variables will be available in your backend (AWS Lambda) application code, and the `REACT_APP_` prefixed ones in your frontend (React) application code.

For more information about this new feature, please visit the updated [Environment Variables](/docs/{exact:5.34.x}/core-development-concepts/basics/environment-variables) article.

### Lifecycle Events ([#2615](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2615))

Because there were some inconsistencies in the naming of the lifecycle events throughout the system, we changed those to be same everywhere.

All the lifecycle events follow, which use publish / subscribe pattern, now look something like this:

- `onEntryBeforeCreate`
- `onModelAfterCreate`
- `onPageBeforeUpdate`
- `onPageUpdateError` - note that this is a bit different, but there is no `before` or `after` when handling an error

All old lifecycle events work, but they are deprecated and will be removed in, probably, `5.36.0` version of Webiny,
