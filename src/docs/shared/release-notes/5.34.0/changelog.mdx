## Page Builder

### New Page Rendering Engine ([#2898](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2898))

✏️

## Mailer

### Default and Configurable Mailer Transports ([#2698](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2698))

The package `@webiny/api-mailer` was upgraded, so we can now define new transports and configure them more easily.

To learn more about our `@webiny/api-mailer` package, please read this [article](/docs/overview/features/mailer).


### Mailer Transport Admin UI Settings ([#2732](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2732))

To make the configuration of the Mailer transports easier, we added the Mailer Settings in the Admin UI.

## Headless CMS

### Advanced (Conditional AND / OR) Filtering ([#2800](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2800)) ([#2916](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2916))

Users can now run the conditional (`AND` and `OR`) filtering in both DynamoDB and DynamoDB + Elasticsearch systems.

To find out more about the advanced filtering, read this [article](/docs/headless-cms/basics/using-graphql-api-advanced-filtering).

### Nested Object Field Filtering ([#2853](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2853)) ([#2905](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2905))

We added a possibility to filter entries by the values in the nested object field.
It does not matter if it is a multiple values object or just a single one, or how deep the data is nested.

Our only recommendation is not to filter really deeply nested objects in the DynamoDB only systems, as it will get slow.


## Development

### App Aliases ([#2895](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2895))

✏️

### Feature Flags ([#2897](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2897))

✏️

### Environment Variables via `webiny.project.ts` ([#2896](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2896))

✏️

## System Wide

### Lifecycle Events ([#2615](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2615))

Because there were some inconsistencies in the naming of the lifecycle events throughout the system, we changed those to be same everywhere.

All the lifecycle events follow, which use publish / subscribe pattern, now look something like this:

* `onEntryBeforeCreate`
* `onModelAfterCreate`
* `onPageBeforeUpdate`
* `onPageUpdateError` - note that this is a bit different, but there is no `before` or `after` when handling an error

All old lifecycle events work, but they are deprecated and will be removed in, probably, `5.36.0` version of Webiny,
