## Mailer

### Default and Configurable Mailer Transports ([#2698](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2698))

The package `@webiny/api-mailer` was upgraded, so we can now define new transports and configure them more easily.

To learn more about our `@webiny/api-mailer` package, please read this [article](/docs/overview/features/mailer).


### Mailer Transport Admin UI Settings ([#2732](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2732))

To make the configuration of the Mailer transports easier, we added the Mailer Settings in the Admin UI.

## System Wide

### Lifecycle Events ([#2615](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2615))

Because there were some inconsistencies in the naming of the lifecycle events throughout the system, we changed those to be same everywhere.

All the lifecycle events follow, which use publish / subscribe pattern, now look something like this:

* `onEntryBeforeCreate`
* `onModelAfterCreate`
* `onPageBeforeUpdate`
* `onPageUpdateError` - note that this is a bit different, but there is no `before` or `after` when handling an error

All old lifecycle events work, but they are deprecated and will be removed in, probably, `5.36.0` version of Webiny,
