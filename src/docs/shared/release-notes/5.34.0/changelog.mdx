## Mailer

### Default and Configurable Mailer Transports ([#2698](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2698))

The package `@webiny/api-mailer` was upgraded, so we can now define new transports and configure them more easily.

To learn more about our `@webiny/api-mailer` package, please read this [article](/docs/overview/features/mailer).


### Mailer Transport Admin UI Settings ([#2732](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2732))

To make the configuration of the Mailer transports easier, we added the Mailer Settings in the Admin UI.
