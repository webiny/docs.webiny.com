## Headless CMS

### Singular And Plural Model API Name ([#3111](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3111))

We added the ability to define the singular and plural model API names for the Headless CMS models.
Before the version `5.35.0`, the API name was always created from the `modelId` property and for the plural, we used [pluralize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pluralize) library, which did not create correct plural names for languages other than the English.

The models created via the Admin UI will always need to have singular and plural API name defined, but the models created via the code will have the singular and plural API name only if they are set as not private.

### Singular And Plural Model API Name Migration ([#3117](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3117))

For the singular and plural model API name functionality, we added a migration which will run after the first deploy.
The migration updates all the models in all the tenants and locales.

Because the handler code is deployed before the migration is executed, existing models do not have the `singularApiName` and `pluralApiName` properties defined, and for that case we have a fallback in the code - so your API does not fail until the migration is executed. The code models should be updated by the users before the deployment.

### Detailed (Advanced) Admin UI Reference Field ([#2969](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2969))

We added a new reference field renderer, called "Detailed view with modal search".
The Detailed renderer is now a default renderer for all the new reference fields, but users can switch to the old one whenever they want to - or from the old one to the new one.

<Image src={modelFieldAppearance} title={"Model Field Appearance Tab"} />
<Image src={referencedItems} title={"List of referenced Items"} />
<Image src={modalSearch} title={"Modal Search of References"} />
<Image src={multipleModelReference} title={"Multiple Model Reference Field"}/>
<Image src={multipleModelReferenceModalDropdown} title={"Multiple Model Reference Field Model Choice Dropdown"} />

### Default Model Fields ([#2977](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2977) [#2978](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2978))

We added the ability create a new model with the default fields defined. Default fields are:
* Title (title) - text field
* Description (description) - long text
* Image (image) - file field with images only

By the default, the checkbox defining the default fields creation is checked, but users can uncheck it if they do not want to create the default fields.
<Image src={modelWithDefaultFields} title={"Model With Default Fields Checkbox"} />

### Model Icon ([#3142](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3142))

We added the possibility to add an icon when creating or editing a model. In the Admin UI there is an icon picker when creating or editing a model.
For the code models, users will need to type in the icon pack identifier and the icon identifier, in form of `packId/iconId`. For example, a newspaper icon is `fas/newspaper`.

We have a few icon packs by default: `@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons` (`fab`), `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` (`fas`) and `@fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons` (`far`).


### Disable Dynamic Zone in the Object Field ([#3160](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3160))

We disabled the possibility to add the Dynamic Zone Field into the Object field. Unfortunately we need to do this, for the moment, as we need to implement structural changes in the Headless CMS for this to properly work.

### GraphQL Schema Types `CmsCreatedBy` and `CmsOwnedBy` Replaced With `CmsIdentity` ([#2969](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2969))

As part of the detailed reference field PR we removed the GraphQL types `CmsCreatedBy` and `CmsOwnedBy` in favor of the `CmsIdentity` type, because they represented the same data.

### GraphQL Schema Cache ([#3201](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3201))
When the user project did not contain any models in the database (created via the UI), GraphQL Schema cache did not work properly as the generated cache key was faulty.
Now we generate a correct key, which is used to cache the GraphQL Schema until the next model change or next deployment of the code.

### Code Content Model Without Validation ([#3187](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3187))
The projects, which have a lot of the CMS Models created via the code, can get a slow API response due to the validation ran on every request.
This PR introduces `noValidate` property on the [CmsModelPlugin](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/3f51fbbbe103a6363d60ad9f591111aa70ae7377/packages/api-headless-cms/src/plugins/CmsModelPlugin.ts#L51), for both the API and Private models.

When using the `noValidate` flag, users will must be extremely careful as we do not check anything they set in that code model.

### Benchmark Measurement Points ([#3185](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3185))

After adding the [Benchmark](#api-benchmark-3183) tool to our system, we added some benchmark points to the Headless CMS.

This allows us, and our users, to figure out where is the bottleneck during the request, if there is one.
Benchmark measurement points cover the GraphQL Schema generation and processing of the request body, at the top level.
The measurements cover all our CMS GraphQL Queries and Mutations as well, as a part of processing the request body step.

## Page Builder

### ✍️ Introducing Page Templates ([#2963](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2963) [#3086](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3086))

✍️

### Multiple UI Improvements

Webiny's Page Builder application has been improved with a new batch of UI improvements.

#### Exporting Blocks From Current Category ([#3109](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3109))

For starters, upon exporting blocks, users can now choose whether they want to only export blocks that belong to the currently selected category of blocks.

<Image src={exportingBlocksFromCategory} title={"Exporting Blocks From Current Category"} />

#### Improved Searching of Blocks ([#2968](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2968))

From now on, typing into the **SEARCH BLOCKS** search field will perform a search across all block categories, where the UI will respond in the following way. 

In the list of block categories (left side), it will filter out categories that don't contain at least one block whose name is matched by the search query. Once a category is clicked, in the list of blocks (right side), only matched blocks will be listed. 

<Image src={improvedBlocksSearch} title={"Improved Searching of Blocks"} />

#### Improved Sorting of Block Categories ([#3099](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3099)) 

Prior to this release, across different screens within the Admin application, we've had different default sorting applied when listing block categories.

For consistency sakes, by default, every list of block categories across different screens within the Admin application will now be sorted alphabetically. User can then apply a different sort, if need be.

#### Multiple Smaller Blocks-related UI Improvements  ([#3106](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3106))

The following are some of the smaller but still useful blocks-related UI improvements we've made.

##### **Edit Block Button**

In the page editor, once a block has been selected on the page canvas, in the right sidebar, the newly added **Edit** button enables users to quickly open the block in the block editor and make necessary changes to it.

<Image src={editBlockButtonEditor} title={"Edit Block Button"} />

##### **Refresh Block Button**

With the **Edit** button, we've also introduced the **Refresh** button. As the name suggests, once clicked, the selected block will be refreshed, reflecting changes that may have been done to the block by the user potentially in a separate browser tab, or by other user. 

<Image src={refreshBlockButtonEditor} title={"Refresh Block Button"} />

##### **Block Name Displayed In the Page Editor**

When a block is selected on the page canvas, the name of the block will be displayed in the top-right corner, making it easier for users to identify blocks on the page. 

<Image src={blockNameInEditor} title={"Block Name Displayed In the Page Editor"} />

##### **Refresh List of Blocks Button**

<Image src={pbEditorRefreshBlocks} title={"Refresh List of Blocks Button"} />

#### Previewing Pages From Revisions List Now Works Correctly ([#3103](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3103))

In the page revisions lists, clicking on the **Preview** link would in certain cases incorrectly redirect users to the public website, instead of page's preview URL.

<Image src={pagePreviewLinkInRevisionsList} title={"Previewing Pages From Revisions List Now Works Correctly"} />

This has now been taken care of. Clicking on the link will correctly redirect the user to page's preview URL.

#### Fixed Highlighting Of Active Page Elements In Page Editor ([#3152](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3152))

In the page editor, when clicking on some page elements like Image and Form, orange borders that surround the element would not be rendered correctly.

<Image src={pbEditorBordersVisible} title={"Fixed Highlighting Of Active Page Elements In Page Editor"} />

This has now been addressed. The orange borders should be rendered correctly for all page elements.

### Trimming of Trailing Slash In Page Path ([#3153](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3153))

In the page editor, in page's general settings, providing a page path that ends with a forward slash would break background page rendering which happens once the page has been published.

<Image src={trailingSlashPbPageSettings} title={"Trimming of Trailing Slash In Page Path"} />

From now on, trailing slashes in page path will be removed, ensuring the page gets rendered correctly once published.

### Using SEO Title Instead Of General Settings Title ([#3155](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3155))

From now on, the title specified in the SEO settings section will be used as the title for published pages (title set via the [`<title>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title) HTML tag).

<Image src={pbSettingsPagePathSeo} title={"Using SEO Title Instead Of General Settings Title"} />

Previously, the title specified via the General settings would be used instead, which, often, we've seen it's not something users would expect. 

<Alert type="info">
  
  The title specified in the General settings section will still be used as the page title if one wasn't specified in the SEO settings section.
  
</Alert>

### Improved Grid and Cell Page Elements ([#3012](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3012))

Grid page element now provides users with a couple of new features in page element settings.

For starters, users can now choose the number of rows for the grid, enabling them to quickly have multiple rows of columns, and not just one.

<Image src={gridMultipleRows} title={"Grids With Multiple Rows"} />

And with the new **Column gap** and **Row gap** settings, users can add spacing between grids and cells:

<Image src={gridCellGaps} title={"Column and Row gap settings"} />

Furthermore, grid cells can now be vertically expanded and take the full height of the parent grid via the new **Column height** setting. 

<Image src={gridCellsExpandHeight} title={"Grid Cells Vertically Expanded"} />

Finally, users can now apply vertical centering of content placed in grid cells.

<Image src={gridVerticalCentering} title={"Vertical Centering Grid Cells Vertically Expanded"} />

### Theme Object Now Available In Emotion Styled Components ([#3141](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3141))

Prior to this release, if users wanted to use [Emotion styled components](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) with their [custom page elements](https://www.webiny.com/docs/page-builder/extending/create-a-page-element) and needed to access the [theme](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/dev/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/theme/theme.ts), they were unable to do it as documented in Emotion's [Theming](https://emotion.sh/docs/theming) documentation article, which is via the [React context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context).

With this release, the theme will internally be loaded into Emotion's `ThemeProvider`, meaning it will be available in your custom Emotion styled components.

The following is an example of an Emotion styled component that uses the theme object:

```tsx
export const HeroSectionWithTheme = styled.div(({ theme }) => ({
    lineHeight: "125%",
    backgroundColor: theme.styles.colors.color1,
    backgroundRepeat: "no-repeat"
}));
```

### Custom Responsive Emotion Styled Components Are Now Rendered Correctly In the Page Editor ([#3141](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3141))

Prior to this release, if users wanted to use [Emotion styled components](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) with their [custom page elements](https://www.webiny.com/docs/page-builder/extending/create-a-page-element), they would be unable to see them adapt to different screen sizes in the page editor, while building their pages. Essentially, different CSS rules defined via [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) would work on the public website, but not in the page editor.

With this release, your custom responsive Emotion styled components should be rendered the same both on the public website and in the page editor.

<Alert type="info">

  Ensuring responsive design works on both public website and in the page editor was achieved via the [`@container` CSS at-rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@container). Essentially, the page canvas in the page editor is now a container, and, while in the page editor, breakpoints and their `@media` queries defined in the [theme](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/dev/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/theme/theme.ts) get transformed into `@container pb-page-canvas` rules.
  
  More information on this can be found in the new [Theming](/docs/{exact:5.35.x}/page-builder/theming/introduction) article.
  
</Alert>

### Introduced `mq` Utility Function For Easier Styling ([#3141](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3141))

One of the tools that is recommended in [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) library's documentation portal is [Facepaint](https://github.com/emotion-js/facepaint). The library enables the developer to easily define CSS rules for multiple pre-defined breakpoints, for example:

```ts
import { css } from 'emotion'
import facepaint from 'facepaint'

const mq = facepaint([
  '@media(min-width: 420px)',
  '@media(min-width: 920px)',
  '@media(min-width: 1120px)'
])

const myClassName = css(mq({
  color: ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'darkorchid'],
}))
```

With this release, we've decided to include this library in the [`@webiny/app-page-builder-elements`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/dev/packages/app-page-builder-elements) package, enabling users to immediately use it, without the need to install it first. Furthermore, by importing the `mq` utility function, users can immediately start writing their per-breakpoint styles, because the function is already configured to follow the breakpoints defined in the  [theme](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/dev/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/theme/theme.ts). For example:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { mq } from "@webiny/app-page-builder-elements";
import styled from "@emotion/styled";

// Basic usage.
export const HeroSection = styled("div")(
    () => mq({ color: ["red", "green", "blue", "gray", "white"] })
);

// With theme being accessed via the `theme` argument:
export const HeroSectionWithTheme = styled("div")(
    {
        lineHeight: "125%",
        backgroundColor: "#fff",
        backgroundRepeat: "no-repeat"
    },
    ({ theme }) =>
        mq({
            color: [
                "red",
                theme.styles.colors.color1,
                theme.styles.colors.color2,
                theme.styles.colors.color3,
                theme.styles.colors.color4
            ]
        })
);
```

### Input Validation With Zod Library ([#3167](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3167)) ([#3194](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3194))
We replaced the Commodo validation (our custom package) with the Zod [library](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod). The validation is now a lot more strict and this is a preparation for the ability for users to customize the validation - not available yet.

### Title and Path Maximum Length ([#3188](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3188))
The Page Builder `title` and `path` properties are now set to be maximum of 500 characters.

### Website - Clicking on Links No Longer Does A Full Page Refresh ([#3215](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3215))

Prior to this release, clicking on links rendered by **Pages List**, **Button**, and **Image** page elements would cause a full page refresh, making the UX for the website visitor not as good as it should be.

This has now been addressed. Clicking on links rendered by these page elements will cause the following page to be rendered immediately, without a page refresh happening.

### Website - Added Missing Tenant Error Message ([#3202](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3202))

Prior to this release, if a user would open their website application in local development and their Webiny project had multi-tenancy feature enabled, then they would just see a blank screen in case the tenant ID hasn't been set previously. No errors would be shown in the browser console too.

Additional point of pain would be the fact that setting the tenant ID is also something that was not clear and, in almost all cases, would left users further confused.

To address this, we've added better error reporting and ensured users are aware what are the next steps. The following is the error message that will be shown to users in their browser:

<Image src={missingTenantErrorMessage} title={"Website - Added Missing Tenant Error Message"} />

### Page Editor - Addressed Canvas Width Indicator Issue ([#3216](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3216))

The canvas width indicator displays the width of the canvas, which changes depending on the selected breakpoint (desktop, tablet, mobile-landscape, mobile-portrait). Due to an internal bug, the indicator would always report **100px** as the width, which was incorrect.

This has now been addressed, so the actual canvas width should now be displayed correctly.

<Image src={editorCanvasWidth} title={"Page Editor - Canvas Width Indicator Now Works Correctly"} />

## Form Builder

### Introduced E-Mail Triggers ([#2957](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2957))

<Image src={fbEmailTrigger1} title={"E-mail - Submission Notification"} />

<Image src={fbEmailTrigger2} title={"E-mail - Thank You E-mail"} />

Under the Form Builder triggers you'll now find two new options. The "E-mail - Submission Notification" trigger sends an email every time a form submission is received. This way it's much easier to stay updated when someone submits one of your forms. 

The "E-mail - Thank You E-mail" trigger sends an email to the user who submitted the form. Inside the email content, you can use the `{fields.FIELD_NAME}` variable to display the form submission data, adding personalization to your emails. 

### Added the Ability to Import/export Forms ([#3077](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3077))

<Image src={fbImportExport} title={"Form Builder - Export form"} />

We've added the ability to export selected forms from the system and easily import them into another system. This way, you can easily move your forms from one environment to another.


### Improved Export Of Submissions  ([#3093](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3093) [#2965](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2965))

We made several updates to the way form submissions are exported. Firstly, the exported CSV file will now contain the exact date and time (UTC) when the submission was created. Secondly, the export format has been improved to make it easier to read. Fields like the checkbox and radio button that previously contained the field value instead of the label, making it hard to read, have been fixed. 



### Introduced Copy Form Submission to Clipboard ([#2952](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2952))

<Image src={fbCopySubmission} title={"Form Builder - Copy submission"} />

When you preview the submission details in the modal dialog you'll notice two new buttons in the top right corner. The "Copy as JSON" and "Copy as CSV" buttons will copy the submission data to your clipboard, so you can easily paste it into another application.

### Ability to Have "Other" Option ([#3031](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3031))

<Image src={fbOtherOption1} title={"Form Builder - Other settings"} />
<Image src={fbOtherOption2} title={"Form Builder - Other preview"} />

We've added the ability to have an "Other" option in the radio button and checkbox fields. This way, you can easily allow users to add a custom value to the field.

### Multiple Improvements on the Default Form Layout ([#3009](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3009) [#2950](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2950) [#2964](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2964))

We've made several improvements to the default form layout. The most notable ones are:

<Image src={fbRequiredToggle} title={"Form Builder - Required toggle"} />

You can now view and toggle the required indicator on and off directly from the form layout editor. 

<Image src={fbRequiredIndicator} title={"Form Builder - Required indicator"} />

Previously the required fields didn't have any indicator on them to show that they are required. We've added a red asterisk to the field label to make it clear that the field is required.

<Image src={fbHelpText} title={"Form Builder - Help text"} />

The position of the field help text has now been moved under the title to make it easier to read.

### Added Basic Form Field ID Validation ([#3017](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3017))

<Image src={fbFieldIdValidator} title={"Form Builder - Field ID Validator"} />

We've added a basic validation to the form field ID. Previously, you could enter any value as the field ID, which could cause different issues in the system. Now, you can only enter letters, numbers, and underscores.

## Cloud Infrastructure

### Removing the Headless CMS AWS Lambda Function ([#2945](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2945))

<Alert type="warning">

  In the 5.35.0 we are removing the Headless CMS Lambda function from the deployment. This is a breaking change, but it is quite simple to fix.

</Alert>

Starting with the `5.35.0` release, there is only a single Lambda Function which handles the requests - the one called GraphQL (`apps/api/graphql`).

We removed the Headless CMS Lambda Function to simplify the development and deployment process for the users.

To learn how to fix the code breaks, please follow the [Upgrade Guide](/docs/release-notes/5.35.0/upgrade-guide).

## Development

### Introduced Application Name-based Environment Variable Naming ([#3095](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3095))

With this release, we're simplifying the way environment variables are defined by users.

We're introducing the following environment variable prefixes, where each prefix designates into which project application the variable will get assigned:

```bash
# Variables with this prefix will get assigned into all AWS Lambda 
# functions deployed as part of the API project application.
WEBINY_API_

# Variables with this prefix will get assigned into the Admin React application.
WEBINY_ADMIN_

# Variables with this prefix will get assigned into the Website React application.
WEBINY_WEBSITE_ 
```

Note that this new feature is backwards compatible. All previously defined environment variables in users' projects will still work as usual.

### Emotion 11 ([#3138](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3138))

With this release, we are upgrading [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/emotion-11) library to version 11.

This upgrade enables Webiny users to use all of the latest and greatest features the library offers. 

For Webiny itself, the new version enabled us to [provide the theme object](#theme-object-now-available-in-emotion-styled-components-3141) upon creating custom Emotion styled components.

 Note that the migration script included with this release will ensure the library is upgraded to the new version. Users do not need to upgrade the library manually.

### New Frontend Utility Functions ([#3126](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3126))

A couple of new useful frontend development-related utility functions have been introduced in this release.

```ts
import {
    getApiUrl,
    getGqlApiUrl,
    getHeadlessCmsGqlApiUrl,
    getLocaleCode,
    getPrerenderId,
    getTenantId,
    isLocalhost,
    isPrerendering
} from "@webiny/app-website"; // Or "@webiny/app-admin".

// Returns URL of Webiny's backend API.
getApiUrl() // https://xyz.cloudfront.net

// Returns URL of Webiny's backend GraphQL API.
getGqlApiUrl() // https://xyz.cloudfront.net/graphql

// Returns URLs of Webiny's backend Headless CMS GraphQL API.
getHeadlessCmsGqlApiUrl() // { preview: "...", manage: "...", read: "..."}

// Returns locale used on the page.
getLocaleCode() // en-US

// Returns current prerendering process' ID.
getPrerenderId() // abc123xyz 
    
// Returns current tenant.
getTenantId() // root

// Returns `true` if the application is run on localhost.
isLocalhost() // true

// Returns true if the page is being prerendered.
isPrerendering() // true
```

Except for the prerendering-related utility functions, these can be used within both Admin and Website applications.


### API Benchmark ([#3183](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3183))

We added the benchmark tool to the main `context` object. It is initialized by default, but it is not enabled.

### Security `withoutAuthorization` Method ([#3176](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3176))

There is now a `withoutAuthorization` method on the `context.security` object. It is intended to replace the `context.security.disableAuthorization()` and `context.security.enableAuthorization()` methods.

The problem with the enable authorization method is that they enable the authorization without any checks. At some points authorization should not be enabled as it was disabled by the user a few levels up from the current code.

The `withoutAuthorization` works in the way that it does disable the authorization, but does not enable it - if it was not already enabled when the disable part kicked in.

This way users can nest the `context.security.withoutAuthorization()` calls without fear of authorization being enabled in the middle of the code execution.

```typescript
const result = await context.security.withoutAuthorization(async() => {
    const params = {
        myParam: 1,
        anotherParam: 2
    }
    return userCustomCodeCallWhichNeedsToHaveAuthorizationDisabled(params);
});
```
