## Page Builder

### Addressed Several Page Builder-related Issues ([#3007](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3007))

With this release, we've again shipped a new batch of Page Builder-related fixes and improvements. The following are some of the more important ones.

#### Theme Border Colors Now Applied Correctly

Prior to this release, in the page editor, upon adding a colored border to an existing page element, if the selected color was defined via theme, it would not get applied correctly. Instead, the default black color would be used. 

We've taken care of this, so you can expect theme (and non-theme) colors to be correctly applied to a page element's border. 

#### Resolved Interactivity Issues On Animated Page Elements

In the page editor, when a page element had an animation enabled, it would lose usual interactivity-related features. For example, users would not be able to type text into text-based page elements, nor drop page elements above or below the animated one. 

Both interactions now work correctly when an element has animation enabled.

#### Image Element Now Renders the Image Using `srcset`

When used, the existing **image** page element now renders the actual image using the [`srcset` HTML attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images), not `src`. This greatly improves the overall website performance because, depending on the user's device screen, browsers serve the image size that's considered to be most optimal.

#### Page Title Correctly Saved When Pressing the Enter Key

Prior to this PR, in the page editor, if a user pressed **Enter** key once they typed a new page title, the new title would not get saved, despite the fact that the user would get presented with a success message.

This issue has now been addressed. 

#### Elements Can Now Be Moved Up and Down On The Canvas (Drag and Drop)

In the page editor, reordering existing page elements via drag and drop method now works correctly.

## Development

### Ability To Define Multiple Production Environments Via `webiny.application.ts`  ([#3014](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3014))

Upon running the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/{exact:5.34.x}/core-development-concepts/basics/project-deployment) command, when `prod` was passed as the environment name, a Webiny project would be deployed in the so-called [production deployment mode](https://www.webiny.com/docs/architecture/deployment-modes/production).

But, if a user wanted to use the same mode for, say, "staging", that would not be easily possible.

That's why we're introducing the `productionEnvironments` parameter for all applications, which can utilized in respective `webiny.application.ts` configuration files. For example:

```ts apps/core/webiny.application.ts
import { createCoreApp } from "@webiny/serverless-cms-aws";

export default createCoreApp({
    pulumiResourceNamePrefix: "wby-",

    // Treats provided environments as production environments, which
    // are deployed in production deployment mode.
    productionEnvironments: ["prod", "staging"]
});

```

Note that when specifying additional production environments, they should be specified across all project applications, meaning:

1. `apps/core/webiny.application.ts`
2. `apps/api/webiny.application.ts`
3. `apps/admin/webiny.application.ts`
4. `apps/website/webiny.application.ts`
