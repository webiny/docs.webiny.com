## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

Upgrade all Webiny NPM packages by running the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.38.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return **5.38.0**.

### 2. Run the Upgrade Command

The next step is to run the project upgrade:

```bash
yarn webiny upgrade
```

### 3. `WEBINY_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_LOCALE` Environment Variable

<Alert type={"info"}>

  If you are not using the [Amazon DynamoDB + Amazon ElasticSearch](docs/architecture/introduction#different-database-setups) database setup, you can skip this step.

</Alert>

Used only with [Amazon DynamoDB + Amazon ElasticSearch](docs/architecture/introduction#different-database-setups) database setup, the `WEBINY_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_LOCALE` environment variable allows users to choose whether they want their ElasticSearch indexes to include a locale code in their names. 

By default, this environment variable is set to `true` via the `.env` file located in the root of your project. It is also recommended to set it to `true` in your CI/CD workflows that deploy your long-lived environments (e.g. `production`). 

To make things simpler for users, with the 5.38.0 release, we've decided to hide this environment variable altogether, and always include the locale code in the index name.

#### What does this mean for existing projects?

If you've had the `WEBINY_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_LOCALE` environment variable set to `true` during development and, more importantly, in your CI/CD workflows that deploy your long-lived environments (e.g. `production`), you don't need to do anything. You can also remove it, and your project will continue to work as expected. 

But, if you had the environment variable set to `false` or you didn't have it set at all, you'll need to ensure its value is set to `false` upon deployment. This goes for both your local development environment and, more importantly, your CI /CD workflows.

```bash
WEBINY_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_LOCALE=false
```

<Alert type={"danger"}>

  Please note that, in case of the latter, failing to apply the above environment variable assignment before deploying will result in your long-lived environments (e.g. `production`) not being able to access the data stored in your ElasticSearch indexes.

  So, make sure to double-check this, and if you're not sure, please contact us on our [Slack](https://www.webiny.com/slack) channel.

### 4. Deploy Your Project

Proceed by redeploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```
