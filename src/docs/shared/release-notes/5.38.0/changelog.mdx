### Advanced Access Control Layer (AACL) - Folder Level Permissions

With this release, we're expanding Webiny's [Advanced Access Control Layer (AACL)](/docs/release-notes/5.37.0/changelog#introducing-advanced-access-control-layer-aacl-2576), by introducing a brand-new feature called **Folder Level Permissions**.

<Image src={flp} alt={"Folder Level Permissions"} shadow={false} />

With this feature, users are now able to define access permissions on a folder level, across the three main Webiny applications: **Headless CMS**, **File Manager**, and **Page Builder**.

More specifically, users that are designated as **folder owners** can now define which users (and also teams with the [Teams](/docs/enterprise/aacl/teams) feature enabled) can access which folders and, subsequently, the content within those folders.

Upon assigning a user to a folder, the folder owner can also define the level of access that the user has to the folder's content. The available access levels are:

- **Viewer** - users can view content, but not modify it
- **Editor** - users can view and modify content
- **Owner** - users can edit and manage content permissions

Once defined, the access permissions are inherited by all subfolders and content within the folder. This means that if a user has access to a folder, they will also have access to all subfolders and content within that folder.

Ultimately, we believe that this feature will be especially useful for larger organizations that have a lot of content and a lot of users, and that need to have an even more granular control over who can access what content.

To learn more, please refer to the newly added [Folder Level Permissions](/docs/key-topics/security/folder-level-permissions) article.
