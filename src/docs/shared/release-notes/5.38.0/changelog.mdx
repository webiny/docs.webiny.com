## Security

### Advanced Access Control Layer (AACL) - Folder Level Permissions ([#3610](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3610))

With this release, we're expanding Webiny's [Advanced Access Control Layer (AACL)](/docs/release-notes/5.37.0/changelog#introducing-advanced-access-control-layer-aacl-2576), by introducing a brand-new feature called **Folder Level Permissions**.

<Image src={flp} alt={"Folder Level Permissions"} shadow={false} />

With this feature, users are now able to define access permissions on a folder level, across the three main Webiny applications: **Headless CMS**, **File Manager**, and **Page Builder**.

More specifically, users that are designated as **folder owners** can now define which users can access which folders and, subsequently, the content within those folders.

Upon doing that, the folder owner also defines the level of access that the user will receive:

- **Viewer** - users can view content, but not modify it
- **Editor** - users can view and modify content
- **Owner** - users can edit and manage content permissions

Once defined, besides the selected folder, the access permissions are also inherited by all subfolders and the content within. In other words, if a user has access to a folder, they will also have access to all subfolders and the content within.

We believe that this feature will be especially useful for teams that are working on large projects, where the content is organized into multiple folders, and where the content is managed by multiple users.

To learn more, please refer to the newly added [Folder Level Permissions](/docs/key-topics/security/folder-level-permissions) article.

## Page Builder

### Improved Previewing of Blocks ([#3329](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3329))

We've improved the way blocks are previewed in the Page Builder app. Previously, whenever a block was saved, a preview image was generated and stored in the database. This image was then used to display the block preview in the Page Builder app.

However, this approach had a few drawbacks, the most important one being that the preview image was not always up-to-date with the actual block content. 

So, with this release, we've changed the way blocks are previewed. Now, instead of generating and storing a preview image, we're using the actual block content to display the preview. This way, the preview is always up-to-date with the actual block content.

## Form Builder

### Multi-Step Forms

With this release, we're introducing support for multi-step forms in the Form Builder app.

<Image src={multiStepForms} alt={"Multi-step Forms"} />

As the name suggests, multi-step forms allow users to break down long forms into multiple steps. This way, users can create more complex forms, while still keeping them simple and easy to fill out. 

In terms of backward compatibility, note that, upon redeploying your Webiny project, a data migration will be triggered, which will automatically convert all existing forms into multi-step forms. In essence, in this process, all form fields from existing forms will be moved into the first step of the form. 

In terms of manual steps, note that you will still need to update your form layout React components, which will partially be handled by the project upgrade script that's included in this release.

For more information, please refer to the newly added [Multi-Step Forms](/docs/key-topics/form-builder/multi-step-forms) article.

## Development

### Revamped Watch Command Output

We've revamped the output for the [`webiny watch`](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/watch-command) command.

<Image src={watchCmd} alt={"Revamped Watch Command Output"} />

When compared to the previous, the new output is much more compact and easier to read. Instead of using three panes to display the build, deploy, and application runtime logs, the command is now printing all logs directly into the terminal. 

Furthermore, the deployment logs have been simplified, only showing basic information about the deployment process. Only in case of an error, the full deployment logs will be printed to the user.
