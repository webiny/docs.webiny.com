## General

### Update System to Use Yarn V4 ([#3621](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3621), [#3623](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3623))

We have updated the system to use Yarn `v4`. This is an update which will require our users to update the version of Yarn in their projects.

Yarn v4 also requires Node `v18` to be running on your system and in your CI/CD pipelines.

There is an option to ignore the Node `v18` requirement, but we would advise against using it:
```
YARN_IGNORE_NODE=1 yarn set version 4.0.0
```
Every time you run some command via yarn, you will need to put the `YARN_IGNORE_NODE=1` before the command.


<Alert type={"info"}>

  Note that Webiny is still running on Node V16 Lambda runtimes.
