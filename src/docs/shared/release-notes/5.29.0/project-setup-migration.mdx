<Alert type={"warning"}>

Before starting with the migration, make sure you're using Webiny version 5.29.0. For more information on
how to upgrade, please check the [Upgrade From 5.28.0 to 5.29.0](/docs/release-notes/5.29.0/upgrade-guide) article.

</Alert>

## Introduction

With the [5.29.0 release](/docs/release-notes/5.29.0/changelog), we've introduced a brand-new project setup. Essentially, the new project setup abstracts a solid amount of files and folders from a Webiny project, making it easier for users to grasp Webiny and develop on top of it. 

## Overview

In order to migrate from the old project structure (projects created before the 5.29 Webiny version) to the new one, we will use the following approach.

Instead of updating the old project and transform it into the new project structure, it has been shown that it's easier to simply create a new 5.29.0 Webiny project, and make the necessary adjustments there.

With the new project created, we can start moving different pieces of our old project, into the new one. Some of these pieces will be:

- custom frontend/backend (Page Builder, GraphQL API) plugins
- different configurations (`yarn`, `.env`, `package.json`, …)
- Pulumi state files

Out of the mentioned pieces, we can immediately highlight Pulumi state files as the piece that will be the most crucial part of the whole migration.

With that being said, here are some additional migration-related notes to take into consideration.

**Performing the Migration**

Note that the document and the steps outline below assume the migration is done from a local machine / from a locally set up project, which has the ability to deploy into the target environment. These can be your regular dev environments, but also long-lived ones.

This is because, at Webiny, we aren’t familiar with internal protocols and CI/CD workflows that you might have in place. It will be up to you to analyse the steps that are presented in this document, and then try to accommodate them to your internal protocols / CI/CD workflows.

<Alert type={"info"}>

  For any questions, feel free to contact us via our [community Slack](https://www.webiny.com/slack).

</Alert> 

**Different Environments**

The steps outlined in this document only cover the migration of a single environment, be it your ordinary development environment, or a long-lived one. If you have 5 environments to migrate, you will need to follow these steps five times, once for each environment.

**Deletion of Old Resources**

Note that the migration will re-use some of the previously deployed cloud infrastructure resources, it will create new ones, but it will also leave some resources hanging. For example, when migrating the API project application, all of the AWS Lambda functions will be created from scratch, and the existing ones will not be deleted via Pulumi.

If possible, after the migration, you should perform an analysis and try to determine which resources are no longer in use, and delete them. Doing this straight from the AWS Console will do.

We will try to mention some of these resources in the section which cover Pulumi state files and deployments.


## Steps

### 1. Create a new Webiny project


On your local machine, create a new Webiny project via the following command:


```bash
npx create-webiny-project {FOLDER_NAME}

```


Note that the wizard that follows will ask you to choose an AWS region and a database setup. Please select the same AWS region and the database setup you were already using.


This new project will be our new base from now on. Once the migration has been completed, the old project won’t be needed anymore (but you can keep it around for some time, just in case).


Once we’ve created the project, we continue by doing the following initial steps in it.

#### 1. Custom Plugins

For starters, we copy all the custom plugins we have in the old project. This includes the `plugins` folder, as well making sure all the plugins inside of it are properly imported in relevant project applications (API, Admin, Website).


#### 2. `.env` Files


If you’re migrating a local / dev-purposed project, then you’re most probably relying on the `.env` file. If so, make sure to copy the file into the new project. On the other hand, if you’re migrating a long-lived environment, environment variables should already be present in CI/CD provider’s secrets vault. In that case, this step can be ignored. 

Then again, if you’re migrating a long-lived environment from a local machine, ensure all of the environment variables, that are usually assigned in a CI/CD workflow, are assigned locally.

From all the environment variables, we should highlight the Pulumi (`PULUMI_SECRETS_PROVIDER`, `PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE`) and AWS environment variables.

Failing to have these values the same will prevent us from performing the actual migration. For example, when it comes to Pulumi-related environment variables, Pulumi usually will throw an error.


#### 3. Package Resolutions

In the new project, we want to keep the same versions of Pulumi-related NPM packages. That’s why, we need to copy the related `resolutions` entries, located in root `package.json` file of our old project:

```bash
"@pulumi/pulumi": "3.19.0",
"@pulumi/aws": "4.28.0",
```

After the change, in the new project, updated `resolutions` block should look like the following:

<Image src={resolutions} canEnlarge={false} style={{width:400}}/>

#### 4. Run `yarn`

In order for the `yarn` and resolutions-related changes to take affect, let’s run `yarn` from the new project’s root.

If the command execution has completed successfully, then we’re ready to start applying cloud infrastructure (Pulumi) code adjustments.


### 2. Apply Cloud Infrastructure (Pulumi) Code Adjustments

Your old project might contain changes in the cloud infrastructure, applied via the code located within the `pulumi` folders. If so, we want to have these as well in the new project.

With the new project structure, all of the project applications are located within the `apps` folder. In it, there are four applications, where each one has its own `webiny.application.ts` file:

1. **Core** ([`apps/core/webiny.application.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.29.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/ddb/apps/core/webiny.application.ts))
2. **API** ([`apps/api/webiny.application.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.29.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/ddb/apps/api/webiny.application.ts))
3. **Admin** ([`apps/admin/webiny.application.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.29.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/admin/webiny.application.ts))
4. **Website** ([`apps/website/webiny.application.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.29.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/website/webiny.application.ts))

These are the files via which the cloud infrastructure adjustments can be applied. To learn more, we suggest you take a look at the [Modify Cloud Infrastructure](/docs/{version}/infrastructure/basics/modify-cloud-infrastructure)


### 3. Pulumi State Files Migration

In this step, we’ll perform the Pulumi state files migration. In other words, we’ll adjust the existing state files that exist in the old project, to the new structure that should exist in the new one.

The main difference is that, in the old project, we had three project applications, thus three sets of state files:

- **API** (`api`)
- **Admin** (`apps/admin`)
- **Website** (`apps/website`)

In the new project, we now have four project apps, thus four sets of state files::

- **Core** (`apps/core`)
- **API** (`apps/api`)
- **Admin** (`apps/admin`)
- **Website** (`apps/website`)

<Alert type={"info"}>

  More info on the new cloud architecture can be found [here](https://www.webiny.com/docs/architecture/introduction).

</Alert> 

At the end of this migration, running the deploy command should result in some changes when it comes to the deployed cloud infrastructure, but the most important part is that all of the stateful services should not be deleted.


#### 1. Exporting Old Project’s State Files

In order to start with the Pulumi state files migration, we need to retrieve the old project’s state files. If you’re migrating a local / dev-purposed project, these should be located in your project root’s `.pulumi` folder. If you’re migrating a long-lived environment, you should retrieve them from the relevant Amazon S3 bucket.


#### 2. Copy Retrieved Pulumi State Files Into the New Project

Once retrieved, we will copy them into the new project. Let’s copy the retrieved Pulumi state files into the `.pulumi-old` folder.


#### 3. Run The State Files Migration Script


For this migration, we provided a migration scrip which can be downloaded [here](#)/


Unzip the provided migration script into your `scripts/migration` folder, and, from your new project root, run the following:


```bash

node scripts/migration/index.js --env xyz --old-pulumi-folder-path ./.pulumi-old --new-pulumi-folder-path ./.pulumi

```


<Alert type={"info"}>

The command uses the `xyz` deployment environment name, so please update this with an actual environment name.

</Alert>


Once the script has completed the state files migration, we’re ready to start deploying our new Webiny project, application by application.


#### 4. Redeploying the Project Apps


We’ll be doing deployments in an application by application manner. We definitely do not want to just run `yarn webiny deploy`, as for each application, we want to preview the deployment, analyse the changes Pulumi will perform, and make sure all is in order.


More on this in the following section.


##### **Core Application (`apps/core`)**


Let’s preview the deployment by running the following command from our new project’s root:


```bash
yarn webiny deploy apps/core --env xyz --preview

# Once the above command has been run, for more info, we
# can also directly run the following Pulumi command:
yarn webiny pulumi apps/core --env xyz -- preview --show-sames --diff

```

The result should be as similar as possible the following:

<Image src={pulumiPreviewCore}/>


As we can see, two create operations and one update operation will be performed.

The create operations are related to new Amazon EventBridge that is now deployed with the new Webiny setup, and also the “block-public-access”  policy for File Manager’s Amazon S3 bucket (ensures bucket objects are not public).


<Alert type={"warning"}>

  Note that the above preview doesn’t show us the changes that were potentially applied via the `apps/core/webiny.application.ts` file on your behalf. If any, you should additionally inspect the preview output and ensure changes you had in place are also intact.
  
</Alert>

If the preview looks correct, then we can proceed with the actual deployment:


```bash
yarn webiny deploy apps/core --env xyz --preview
```

The result should be the following:

<Image src={pulumiDeployCore}/>

##### **API Application (`apps/api`)**

When it comes to the API application, we’ve decided to go with the following approach.

Since the application is stateless (unlike with the **Core** application, which is stateful), to minimise the possibility of an error in Pulumi state files, we’ll completely redeploy this application.

Except for the Amazon Cloudfront. This is because, in your long-lived environments, most probably there are real domains linked with already deployed Amazon Cloudfront distributions. By not redeploying distributions, we're making the migration easier.

Once we run the following preview command:

```bash
yarn webiny deploy apps/api --env xyz --preview

# Once the above command has been run, for more info, we 
# can also directly run the following Pulumi command:
yarn webiny pulumi apps/api --env xyz -- preview --show-sames --diff
```

The result should be the following:

<Image src={pulumiPreviewApi}/>

As we can see, all of the resources will be recreated, except for the `api-cloudfront` one, which shows changes in the `defaultCacheBehavior,orderedCacheBehaviors,origins`.

If we were to further inspect those with the second preview command we mentioned above:

```bash
yarn webiny pulumi apps/api --env xyz -- preview --show-sames --diff
```

…we’d see the following changes:

<Image src={pulumiPreviewApi2}/>

As we can see, we have changes in `targetOriginId` properties and within the `origins` property. Essentially, the existing Amazon Cloudfront distribution is just linked with the newly deployed API Gateway. If those are the only differences that the preview command showed, then we’re almost ready to deploy.

<Alert type={"warning"}>

  Note that the above preview doesn’t show us the changes that were potentially applied via the `apps/api/webiny.application.ts` file on your behalf. If any, you should additionally inspect the preview output and ensure changes you had in place are also intact.

</Alert>

We say “almost”, because we have to perform one additional step before doing it. If we were to deploy immediately, there’s a chance an error would be thrown, saying a `APW#SETTINGS` DynamoDB record cannot be created:

<Image src={apwSettingsDdbRecord}/>

It’s a record that gets created during the deployment (also defined within internal Pulumi infrastructure code). Unfortunately, at this time, Pulumi doesn’t allow us to ignore or overwrite existing DynamoDB records. If the same record already exists, an error will be thrown.


So, in order to fix the issue, we’ll have to go into our AWS console, find the relevant DynamoDB table, and manually delete the record shown in the above screenshot (`APW#SETTINGS`).  Note that if you don’t have the record in the table, there’s nothing to do then.

<Alert type={"info"}>
  You can find the name of the relevant DynamoDB table name in the stack output that was returned as the result of the deployment of the Core application (in previous step).
</Alert>

Once deleted, we’ve completed all the necessary pre-deployment steps, so we can start the deployment.

We can start the deployment via the following command:


```bash
yarn webiny deploy apps/api --env xyz
```

The result should be something like the following:

<Image src={pulumiDeployApi}/>


From the logs above, we can see it’s Amazon Cloudfront distribution that received changes seen in the previous preview command:

<Image src={pulumiDeployApi2}/>

If that is the case, then we’re ready for the next step, which is redeploying the Admin app.


##### **Admin Application (`apps/admin`)**

As before, the first step we want to take before deploying the Admin application is performing the deployment preview:

```bash
yarn webiny deploy apps/admin --env xyz --preview

# Once the above command has been run, for more info, we 
# can also directly run the following Pulumi command:
yarn webiny pulumi apps/admin --env xyz -- preview --show-sames --diff
```

The result should be the following:

<Image src={pulumiPreviewAdmin}/>

As we can see, we can see three **create** and two **update** operations.

All operations are related to making the Amazon S3 bucket (that hosts the Admin app) private. In a nutshell, we disable the website hosting feature form the Amazon S3 bucket, block all public access to it, and introduce Amazon Cloudfront Origin Access Identity, which enables us to ensure only HTTP requests that are coming from the deployed Amazon Cloudfront distribution can be actually served.

If these are the changes that the preview command reported, then we’re ready to deploy.

<Alert type={"warning"}>

  Note that the above preview doesn’t show us the changes that were potentially applied via the `apps/admin/webiny.application.ts` file on your behalf. If any, you should additionally inspect the preview output and ensure changes you had in place are also intact.

</Alert>

Before running the deploy, just in case, it’s not a bad idea to do a refresh:

```bash
yarn webiny pulumi apps/admin --env xyz -- refresh --yes

```

This will ensure current state files are synced with what is already deployed with the old project.

```bash
yarn webiny deploy apps/admin --env xyz
```

The result should be the following:

<Image src={pulumiDeployAdmin}/>

**Website Application (`apps/website`)**

Finally, the Website application. To perform the deployment preview, we can run the following commands:

```bash
yarn webiny deploy apps/website --env xyz --preview

# Once the above command has been run, for more info, we 
# can also directly run the following Pulumi command:
yarn webiny pulumi apps/website --env xyz -- preview --show-sames --diff
```

The result should be the following:

<Image src={pulumiPreviewWebsite}/>

<Alert type={"warning"}>

  Note that the above preview doesn’t show us the changes that were potentially applied via the `apps/website/webiny.application.ts` file on your behalf. If any, you should additionally inspect the preview output and ensure changes you had in place are also intact.

</Alert>

As we can see, a lot of **create** operations. But this is mainly because of the fact that the Page Builder’s Prerendering Service is no longer deployed as part of the API application, but as part of the Website application. All of these are related to the Prerendering Service:

<Image src={pulumiPreviewWebsite2}/>

What about the rest?

<Image src={pulumiPreviewWebsite3}/>


The rest is related to, as with the Admin application, making the Amazon S3 buckets publicly inaccessible.


There’s also the Amazon Cloudfront function / Amazon Lambda@Edge function, that are here for multi-tenancy routing purposes (if enabled).

Finally, similarly to what we had in the API application section, a `PS#SETTINGS` Amazon DynamoDB entry will be created in the process. Meaning, in order to avoid the error we explained above, we’ll need to find the record via the DynamoDB console, and delete it:

<Image src={psSettingsDdbRecord}/>

Once the record has been deleted, we can start with the deployment.

So, to deploy the changes, for starters, as with the Admin application, we recommend a refresh is performed with the following command:

```bash
yarn webiny pulumi apps/website --env xyz -- refresh --yes
```

Once completed, the deployment can be performed via the following command:

```bash
yarn webiny deploy apps/website --env xyz
```

The following is a result we should receive:

<Image src={pulumiDeployWebsite}/>

As we can see, 32 **create** and four **update** operations have been performed.

With the Website application, we’ve completed the Pulumi state files migration. The only thing left to do is manually test the re-deployed system and ensure everything is working as expected. To get started, we suggest running the `yarn webiny info --env xyz` command, and opening the Admin application in your browser:

<Image src={webinyInfo}/>

If everything works as expected, we can finalize the migration by copying the migrated Pulumi state files in our state files storage.

More on this in the next section.

#### 5. Store Migrate Pulumi State Files

Once we’ve determined everything is in order, the final step would be to copy the migrated Pulumi files back into its original storage.

If you’re migrating a local / dev-purposed project, then there are no extra steps because you already have everything up-to-date in your local `.pulumi` folder. On the other hand, if you’re migrating a long-lived environment, migrated Pulumi state files should be copied back into the storage you’re using, for example an existing Amazon S3 bucket.

Once done, we suggest a deployment preview is run against every application. If the state files were copied back correctly, then the preview should report no changes / nothing to deploy.

Finally, it might not also be a bad idea to additionally try to make a small change in the cloud infrastructure (Pulumi) code, and try to preview/deploy it. Adding an extra resource tag might be a simple yet good-enough change to test.

## Conclusion

By successfully completing the above steps, you should have your existing Webiny project migrated to the new project structure, and be able to enjoy all of the benefits that it brings.

We are aware that the migration process is a lengthy and a non-trivial one. So, if additional questions arise or you need additional help, feel free to ping us via our [community Slack](https://www.webiny.com/slack). We'd be glad to assist!
