## Page Builder

### Public Website Rerendering ([#3570](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3570))

Prior to this release, the public website would not fully refresh (re-render) after a successful deployment of the **Website** project application. This was happening due to an issue in the underlying website prerendering service. 

This issue has been addressed. Now, after a successful deployment, the public website will be fully refreshed.

### Addressed A Block Export/Import Issue ([#3552](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3552))

We've addressed an issue where importing exported page blocks would fail if a block's category was not present in the target system. We've been dealing with this issue in the past, but, as we've found out, it was not fully addressed.

## Headless CMS

### Clone Content Model Button Now Hidden For Users Without Required Permissions ([#3553](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3553))

We've addressed an issue where users without the required security permissions were still able to see the **Clone Content Model** button in the list of all content models. 

This button is now hidden for users without the required permissions.
