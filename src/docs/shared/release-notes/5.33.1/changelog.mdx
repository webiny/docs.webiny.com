## Headless CMS

### CMS Model Field Aliases ([#2611](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2611))

A fix for the alias to storageId converter, when having deeply nested object field. This is internal part of code, so no need to update code in your project. Just update to this version of Webiny.
