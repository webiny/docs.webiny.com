## Our Products

Webiny CMS is a self-hosted product that runs in the customer’s own cloud infrastructure. Data that is generated and created by the product is processed and stored with the cloud provider.

Webiny Control Panel is a management dashboard that tracks usage and license terms of individual Webiny CMS instances. It is a SAAS product that is hosted on our AWS account.

## Transparency and Improvement

We have created this page to be fully transparent about the information we collect, how we use and store it. We want to add that this data doesn't reveal any personal identifiable information (PII) of you as an individual.

We use the data in an honest way and with a single purpose - to improve Webiny as a product for yourself and the wider community.

## What data do you collect?

We collect these different types of telemetry data:

1. [CMS Product Analysis](#1-product-analytics)
2. [CMS Usage Analytics](#2-usage-analytics)
3. [Users and Environments (via Webiny Control Panel)](#3-users-and-environments)

### 1. Product Analytics

The product analytics are optional; you have control to turn it on or off. 

Product analytics help us build a better product by better understanding the usage patterns of Webiny CMS. The product analytics data is captured within the Webiny CMS Admin dashboard, and within the Webiny CLI utility.

### 2. Usage Analytics

Usage analytics track the number of API calls and number of user seats the customer is using. The data is anonymized and tracked as a cumulative number only. Usage analytics are used to ensure the customer is using the product within the agreed terms and conditions defined by the Webiny Enterprise contract. Usage analytics are mandatory and cannot be turned off.

### 3. Users and Environments 

This data is only obtained via Webiny Control Panel.

Webiny Control Panel requires every Webiny Enterprise customer to register for an account. Through Webiny Control Panel the customer can see their usage and ensure it’s within the agree license terms. 

Each member of the customer’s development team working on making code changes to Webiny CMS also requires an account to retrieve the appropriate Webiny license for their own personal development environment.

## Is the Data Stored or Distributed to a 3rd Party?

No, the data is collected by a service running in our own infrastructure and is not collected or distributed to any 3rd parties.

## What About Sensitive Data? (e.g. Secrets)

We do not track anything other than what is specified above.
