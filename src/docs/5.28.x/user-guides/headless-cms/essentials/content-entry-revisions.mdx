In Webiny, each modification in a content entry that is saved or published is stored as a separate revision.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to create multiple revisions of a content entry and publish a specific revision.
We will also learn how to create a new content entry version from a previous revision.
As an example, we will use the **Product** content model that we created in the [Create Content Model](../essentials/create-content-model) tutorial:

We will do this in 3 steps:
- Step 1: Create a content entry in the **Product** content model and make multiple revisions.
- Step 2: Publish a previous revision of the content entry.
- Step 3: Create a new content entry version from a previous revision.

## Step 1: Create a Content Entry and Its Revisions

If you are not familiar with how to create a content entry, please follow the [Create Content Entry](../essentials/create-content-entry) tutorial.

1. Create a content entry in the **Product** content model with the following attributes:

    | Field       | Value                                                              |
    | :-------    | :----------                                                        |
    | Name        | **Men's Blue T-Shirt**                                             |
    | Description | **Half Sleeved, Regular fit, Cotton blend, Blue T-shirt for Men**  |
    | Price       | **15**                                                             |
    | Category    | **Clothes**                                                        |

    **Note**: If you haven't added the **Category** field to the **Product** content model, skip it (or add it by following the [Reference Field](../essentials/reference-field) tutorial).

2. Now, update the **Name** and **Description** textboxes with the following values:

    | Field       | Value                                                                    |
    | :-------    | :----------                                                              |
    | Name        | **Men's Solid Blue T-Shirt**                                             |
    | Description | **Half Sleeved, Regular fit, Cotton blend, Solid, Blue T-shirt for Men** |

3. Click **SAVE & PUBLISH**.

    **Note**: Clicking **SAVE** will create a new version of the content entry with updated field values and save it as a draft.
    Whereas clicking **SAVE & PUBLISH** will create a new version and publish it.

4. Create another revision by updating the **Name** and **Description** textboxes with the following values:

    | Field       | Value                                                                                |
    | :-------    | :----------                                                                          |
    | Name        | **Men's Solid Round Neck Blue T-Shirt**                                              |
    | Description | **Round Neck, Half Sleeved, Regular fit, Cotton blend, Solid, Blue T-shirt for Men** |
