- how to clone a content model

</Alert>

Webiny allows you to create a new content model by making a clone of an existing content model. The clone has the same fields, validations, and other settings as the original content model.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to clone a content model. As an example, we will create a content model with the following attributes by cloning an existing content model:

| Attribute   | Value                  |
| :-------    | :----------------------|
| Name        | E-Commerce             |
| Group icon  | 🛒                     |
| Description | E-Commerce Model Group |

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need the **Product** content model to clone it.
If you don't have the **Product** content model that we created in the [Create Content Model](../essentials/create-content-model) tutorial, please create it.

## Clone Content Model

1. From the **Side Menu**, Click **Headless CMS** > **Models**.

2. Hover on the **Product** content model.

3. Click the **CLONE CONTENT MODEL** icon ( *clone icon required* ).

    ✔️ The **Clone Content Model** screen opens.

4. In the **Name** textbox, update the text to **Virtual Product**.

5. In the **Content model locale** dropdown, click **Current locale**.

6. In the **Content model group** dropdown, click **E-Commerce**.

7. In the **Description** textbox, update the text to **Demo Virtual Product Content Model for E-Commerce project**.
    
    ( *Description textbox is uneditable in the CMS.* )

8. Click **+ CLONE**.
