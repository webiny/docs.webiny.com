## Overview

With the 5.38.0 release, we've expanded Webiny's [Advanced Access Control Layer (AACL)](/docs/release-notes/5.37.0/changelog#introducing-advanced-access-control-layer-aacl-2576), by introducing a brand-new feature called **Folder Level Permissions**.

<Image src={flp} alt={"Folder Level Permissions"} shadow={false} />

With this feature, users can define access permissions on a folder level. More specifically, users that are designated as **folder owners** can now define which users (and also teams with the [Teams](/docs/enterprise/teams) feature enabled) can access which folders, and what actions they can perform on those folders:

- **Viewer** - users can view content, but not modify it
- **Editor** - users can view and modify content
- **Owner** - users can edit and manage content permissions

Folder Level Permissions can be used across the three main Webiny applications: **Headless CMS**, **File Manager**, and **Page Builder**.

## Enabling Teams and Feature Overview

For Webiny Enterprise users, apart from [linking their Webiny project](/docs/wcp/link-a-project) with Webiny Control Panel (WCP), there are no additional steps required to enable Teams.

Once linked, Folder Level Permissions will be automatically enabled and the module can be accessed from the main menu:

Via the Teams module, users can create new teams that consist of one or more security roles.

Once a team is created, users can assign it to one or more users. This can be done by editing the user and selecting the team via the Team field.
