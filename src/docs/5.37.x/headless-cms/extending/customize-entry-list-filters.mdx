## Overview

By default, Headless CMS offers a single built-in filter to help you quickly filter entries based on their status (draft, published, unpublished). 

To work with filters, you need to use the `ContentEntryListConfig` component. For this article, we will use the `Filter` component, located in the `Browser` namespace. 

```diff-tsx apps/admin/src/App.tsx
import React from "react";
import { Admin } from "@webiny/app-serverless-cms";
import { Cognito } from "@webiny/app-admin-users-cognito";
+ import { ContentEntryListConfig } from "@webiny/app-headless-cms";
import "./App.scss";

+ // You can destructure child components to make the code more readable and easier to work with.
+ const { Browser } = ContentEntryListConfig;

export const App: React.FC = () => {
    return (
      <Admin>
        <Cognito />
+       <ContentEntryListConfig>
+          <Browser.Filter name={"demo-filter"} element={<span>Demo Filter</span>} />
+       </ContentEntryListConfig>
      </Admin>
    );
};
```

In the admin app, Browser is the main area of a Content Model Entry List, where users browse entries, apply filters, perform searching, organize entries into folders, create new entries, etc.

The code examples below are based on a content model called `Property` with the following fields: 

- `title` text input
- `price` number input

## Add a Filter

To add a new filter, you need a regular React element to pass to the `Browser.Filter` component through the `element` prop. You must also include the `name` prop, which serves as a unique identifier, enabling further interactions, such as positioning, removing, and replacing.

```diff-tsx apps/admin/src/App.tsx
import React from "react";
import { Admin } from "@webiny/app-serverless-cms";
import { Cognito } from "@webiny/app-admin-users-cognito";
+ import { ContentEntryListConfig } from "@webiny/app-headless-cms";
import "./App.scss";

+ const { Browser } = ContentEntryListConfig;

+ const DemoFilter = () => {
+   return <span>Demo Filter</span>;
+ }

export const App: React.FC = () => {
    return (
      <Admin>
        <Cognito />
+       <ContentEntryListConfig>
+         <Browser.Filter
+           name={"demo-filter"}
+           element={<DemoFilter />}
+           modelIds={["property"]}
+         />
+       </ContentEntryListConfig>
      </Admin>
    );
};
```

By declaring the `modelIds` prop, you can define in which Content Model Entry List you want to show your custom filter. If you exclude this prop, the filter will be registered for all models in the system.

In the example above, the next time you open your `property` content model browser and expand the filters bar, you'll see your new element there. This is the whole process of registering a new filter element. In the following sections, we'll focus on implementing actual filtering.

### Simple Filter

Here's an example of how to create a filter that displays only "Deluxe" properties. We consider a property to be "Deluxe" if its price is over 1 million. It's important to note that we're only providing the filter implementation and not the registration process, which can be found in the previous section.

```tsx
import { useBind } from "@webiny/form";
import { Switch } from "@webiny/ui/Switch";

const DemoFilter = () => {
  const bind = useBind({
    name: "price_gt"
  });

  const toggleFilter = () => {
    bind.onChange(bind.value ? undefined : 1000000);
  };

  return <Switch {...bind} label={"Show deluxe properties only"} onChange={toggleFilter} />;
};

/* Register your custom filter. */
<ContentEntryListConfig>
  <Browser.Filter 
    name={"demo-filter"} 
    element={<DemoFilter />} 
    modelIds={["property"]} />
</ContentEntryListConfig>;
```

Under the hood, filters are handled via a regular form component: this means we can hook into the form to set new filter values. We're using the `useBind` hook and give it a name. This `name` will become a key within the form data object, which will be passed to the GraphQL query. To unset a filter, we set `undefined`.

<Image src={hcmsToggleFilter} title="Toggle Filter in Action" />

### Advanced Filter

Sometimes, you need to implement filtering logic that is more complex than just setting a single value. The following example shows a filter in the form of a dropdown menu, where each option needs to use a different GraphQL query operator. `> 500k` needs to use the `price_gt` key, while `< 500k` needs to use the `price_lt` key. This cannot be achieved with simple form binding.

To correctly format our filters, we'll use the `Browser.FiltersToWhere` component to register our custom converter, allowing you to convert form data to a valid GraphQL query input. With this approach, you have full control over values that will be passed to the API when the user interacts with the filters UI.

```tsx
import { useBind } from "@webiny/form";
import { Select } from "@webiny/ui/Select";

export const FilterByPrice = () => {
  const bind = useBind({
    name: "price",
    defaultValue: "all",
    beforeChange(value, cb) {
      cb(value === "all" ? undefined : value);
    }
  });

  const options = [
    { label: "All", value: "all" },
    { label: "> 500k", value: "gt:500000" },
    { label: "< 500k", value: "lt:500000" }
  ];

  return <Select {...bind} placeholder={"Filter by price"} options={options} size="medium" />;
};

const convertFilters = ({ price, ...rest }: any) => {
  if (!price) {
    return rest;
  }

  const [operator, value] = price.split(":");
  return { ...rest, [`price_${operator}`]: parseInt(value) };
};

/* Register your custom filter, and the filters converter. */
<ContentEntryListConfig>
  <Browser.Filter name={"price"} element={<FilterByPrice />} />
  <Browser.FiltersToWhere converter={convertFilters} />
</ContentEntryListConfig>;
```

<Image src={hcmsDropdownFilter} title="Dropdown Filter in Action" />

<Alert type={"info"} title={"Multiple Converters"}>
  You can add as many converters as you need. The output of the previous converter will be passed as an
  input to the next converter.

## Discovering Filters

This section demonstrates how you can discover the names of existing filters. This is important for further sections on positioning, removing, and replacing filters.

The easiest way to discover existing filters is to use your browser's React Dev Tools plugins and look for the `Filters` element. From there, you can either look for `filters` props or look at the child elements and their keys:

<Image src={hcmsDiscoverFilters} title="Discover Existing Filters" />

## Positioning a Filter

To position your custom filter before or after an existing filter, you can use the `before` and `after` props on the `<Browser.Filter>` element:

```tsx
<ContentEntryListConfig>
  <Browser.Filter name={"price"} element={<FilterByPrice />} before={"type"} />
</ContentEntryListConfig>
```

<Image src={hcmsPositionBefore} title="Position Your Filter Before Another Filter" />

## Removing a Filter

Sometimes you might want to remove an existing filter. All you need to do is reference the filter by name and pass a `remove` prop to the `<Browser.Filter>` element:

```tsx
<ContentEntryListConfig>
  <Browser.Filter name={"type"} remove />
</ContentEntryListConfig>
```

## Replacing a Filter

To replace an existing filter with a new filter element, you need to reference an existing filter by name and pass a new component via the `element` prop:

```tsx
<ContentEntryListConfig>
  <Browser.Filter name={"type"} element={<span>A new filter!</span>} />
</ContentEntryListConfig>
```
