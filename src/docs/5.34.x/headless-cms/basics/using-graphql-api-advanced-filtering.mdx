- how to use the Headless CMS GraphQL API advanced filtering
- how are `AND` and `OR` nested queries working

</Alert>

## Overview

In the 5.34.0 version of Webiny we introduced the `AND` and `OR` conditionals to help users filter the CMS entries.

Both `AND` and `OR` conditionals are arrays (lists) of the available filters, which depend on the model you are running the query for.

## The `AND` Conditional

The `AND` conditional is the extension of our existing filtering. It works the same as our old GraphQL filtering, with the addition of nested filters.

This conditional requires all the filters sent to match.

Also, when sending filters in the root of the `where` object, there is no need for the `AND` keyword - but you can use it, of course.

### Simple `AND` Examples

#### Example #1

In this example we are searching for articles which:

- have a title with both `headless` and `cms` words in it

```graphql
query {
  listArticles(where: { AND: [{ title_contains: "headless" }, { title_contains: "cms" }] }) {
    data {
      id
      title
    }
    meta {
      hasMoreItems
      cursor
      totalCount
    }
    error {
      message
      code
      data
    }
  }
}
```

This query will produce something like `(title_contains = "headless" AND title_contains = "cms")`.

In our old GraphQL you could not do that, because you could send only one `title_contains` in the `where` object.

#### Example #2

Also, you can add a filter in the root level of the `where` object.

In this example we are searching for articles which:

- are in a category with ID `1`
- have a title with both `headless` and `cms` words in it.

```graphql
query {
  listArticles(
    where: { categoryId: 1, AND: [{ title_contains: "headless" }, { title_contains: "cms" }] }
  ) {
    data {
      id
      title
    }
    meta {
      hasMoreItems
      cursor
      totalCount
    }
    error {
      message
      code
      data
    }
  }
}
```

This query will produce something like `(categoryId = 1 AND title_contains = "headless" AND title_contains = "cms")`.

### Complex `AND` Examples

#### Example #1

In this example we are searching for articles which:

- are in a category with ID `1`
- have a title with both `headless` and `cms` words in it
- are written by authors with IDs `5` or `6` or `7`
- are created in `2022`

```graphql
query {
  listArticles(
    where: {
      categoryId: 1
      AND: [
        { title_contains: "headless" }
        { title_contains: "cms" }
        { AND: [{ author_in: [5, 6, 7] }, { createdOn_between: ["2022-01-01", "2022-12-31"] }] }
      ]
    }
  ) {
    data {
      id
      title
    }
    meta {
      hasMoreItems
      cursor
      totalCount
    }
    error {
      message
      code
      data
    }
  }
}
```

This query will produce something like `(categoryId = 1 AND title_contains = "headless" AND title_contains = "cms" AND (author_in = [5, 6, 7] AND createdOn_gte = "2022-01-01" AND createdOn_lte = "2022-12-31"))`.

#### Example #2

All of these filters can be written in the root of the `where` object (except `title_contains` - because there are multiple):

```graphql
query {
  listArticles(
    where: {
      categoryId: 1
      AND: [{ title_contains: "headless" }, { title_contains: "cms" }]
      author_in: [5, 6, 7]
      createdOn_between: ["2022-01-01", "2022-12-31"]
    }
  ) {
    data {
      id
      title
    }
    meta {
      hasMoreItems
      cursor
      totalCount
    }
    error {
      message
      code
      data
    }
  }
}
```

The query above will produce the same result as the previous one, where we have nested `AND` conditional.

## The `OR` Conditional

The `OR` conditional brings completely new, and powerful, way of filtering the CMS entries.

This conditional requires only a single filter to match.

### Simple `OR` Example

#### Example #1

In this example we are searching for articles which:

- have a title with `headless` or `cms` words in it

```graphql
query {
  listArticles(where: { OR: [{ title_contains: "headless" }, { title_contains: "cms" }] }) {
    data {
      id
      title
    }
    meta {
      hasMoreItems
      cursor
      totalCount
    }
    error {
      message
      code
      data
    }
  }
}
```

This query will produce something like `(title_contains = "headless" OR title_contains = "cms")`.

#### Example #2

In this example we are searching for articles which match any of the conditions:

- have a title with `cms` word in it
- have a title with `headless` word in it and are in category with ID `1`

```graphql
query {
  listArticles(
    where: { OR: [{ title_contains: "headless", categoryId: 1 }, { title_contains: "cms" }] }
  ) {
    data {
      id
      title
    }
    meta {
      hasMoreItems
      cursor
      totalCount
    }
    error {
      message
      code
      data
    }
  }
}
```

This query will produce something like `((title_contains = "headless" AND categoryId = 1) OR title_contains = "cms")`.

As you can notice, having more than one filter in an `OR` block produces the **match all** in that `OR` block.

We will cover the mixed `AND` and `OR` conditionals later in this article.

### Complex `OR` Example

#### Example #1

In this example we are searching for articles which match any of the conditions:

- have a title with `headless` word in it
- have a title with `cms` word in it
- are in either category with ID `1` or `2`

```graphql
query {
  listArticles(
    where: {
      OR: [
        { title_contains: "headless" }
        { title_contains: "cms" }
        { OR: [{ categoryId: 1 }, { categoryId: 2 }] }
      ]
    }
  ) {
    data {
      id
      title
    }
    meta {
      hasMoreItems
      cursor
      totalCount
    }
    error {
      message
      code
      data
    }
  }
}
```

This query will produce something like `(title_contains = "headless" OR title_contains = "cms" OR (categoryId = 1 OR categoryId = 2))`.

## The Mix of `AND` and `OR` Conditionals

### Root Level `OR` Conditional With Nested `AND` and `OR` Conditionals

In this example we are searching for articles which match any of the conditions:

- have a title with `headless` word in it
- have a title with `cms` word in it
- have both `webiny` and `serverless` in the title and are created in `January of 2021` or `January of 2022`

```graphql
query {
  listArticles(
    where: {
      OR: [
        { title_contains: "headless" }
        { title_contains: "cms" }
        {
          AND: [
            { title_contains: "webiny" }
            { title_contains: "serverless" }
            {
              OR: [
                { createdOn_between: ["2021-01-01", "2021-01-31"] }
                { createdOn_between: ["2022-01-01", "2022-01-31"] }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ) {
    data {
      id
      title
    }
    meta {
      hasMoreItems
      cursor
      totalCount
    }
    error {
      message
      code
      data
    }
  }
}
```

This query will produce something like `(title_contains = "headless" OR title_contains = "cms" OR (title_contains = "webiny" AND title_contains = "serverless" AND ((createdOn_gte = "2021-01-01" AND createdOn_lte = "2021-01-31") OR (createdOn_gte = "2022-01-01" AND createdOn_lte = "2022-01-31"))))`.

### Root Level `AND` Conditional With Nested `OR` and `AND` Conditionals

In this example we are searching for articles which match all the conditions:

- have a title with `headless` word in it
- have a title with `cms` word in it
- have any of the `webiny` or `serverless` in the title or are created in `January of 2021` or `January of 2022`

```graphql
query {
  listArticles(
    where: {
      AND: [
        { title_contains: "headless" }
        { title_contains: "cms" }
        {
          OR: [
            { title_contains: "webiny" }
            { title_contains: "serverless" }
            {
              AND: [
                { createdOn_between: ["2021-01-01", "2021-01-31"] }
                { createdOn_between: ["2022-01-01", "2022-01-31"] }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ) {
    data {
      id
      title
    }
    meta {
      hasMoreItems
      cursor
      totalCount
    }
    error {
      message
      code
      data
    }
  }
}
```

This query will produce something like `(title_contains = "headless" AND title_contains = "cms" AND (title_contains = "webiny" OR title_contains = "serverless" OR ((createdOn_gte = "2021-01-01" AND createdOn_lte = "2021-01-31") AND (createdOn_gte = "2022-01-01" AND createdOn_lte = "2022-01-31"))))`.

### Root Level `OR` and `AND` Conditionals

In this example we are searching for articles which:

- are written by author with ID `1` OR are in category with ID `2`
- have a title with `headless` and `cms` words in it

```graphql
query {
  listArticles(
    where: {
      OR: [{ author: 1 }, { categoryId: 2 }]
      AND: [{ title_contains: "headless" }, { title_contains: "cms" }]
    }
  ) {
    data {
      id
      title
    }
    meta {
      hasMoreItems
      cursor
      totalCount
    }
    error {
      message
      code
      data
    }
  }
}
```


This query will produce something like `((author = 1 OR categoryId = 2) AND (title_contains = "headless" AND title_contains = "cms"))`.

<Alert type="warning">

While users can nest `AND` and `OR` conditionals indefinitely, they need to be aware that it might result in performance issues, especially in the DynamoDB only systems.
