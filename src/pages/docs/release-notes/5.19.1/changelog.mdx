## File Manager

### Fix Error When Listing File Tags ([#2114](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2114))

When user uploaded a file without tags, the listing query of the tags failed with an error.

The projects created with DynamoDB-only database were affected. DynamoDB + Elasticsearch is working as expected.
