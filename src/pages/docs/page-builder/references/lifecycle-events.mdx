<Alert type="info">

Lifecycle events using publish/subscribe pattern replace the PagePlugin hooks starting from version 5.20.0.

</Alert>

## Overview

In our Page Builder we provide lifecycle events available for you to hook into.
Lifecycle events are triggered before (`onBefore` keyword) and after (`onAfter` keyword) the data is stored into the database.

With `onBefore` events you can change the data that is being stored into the database, so be careful with that.

With the lifecycle events you can hook into a number of different operations, for example:

- change the page data which is going to be stored
- notify another system that new page was stored

## System

### onBeforeInstall

This event is triggered before the installation of the Page Builder and insertion of initial `Welcome to Webiny` and `Not Found` pages.

#### Event arguments

| tenant   | ID of the current tenant |

#### How to subscribe to this event?

```typescript
new ContextPlugin<PbContext>(async (context) => {
  context.pageBuilder.onBeforeInstall.subscribe(async ({ tenant }) => {
    await notifyAnotherSystemThatPageBuilderIsGettingInstalled({ tenant })
  })
})
```

### onAfterInstall

## Registering Lifecycle Event Subscriptions

<Alert type="danger">

Please, be aware that you can change what ever you want on the object before it is stored into the database, so be careful with changing the data.

</Alert>

For the subscriptions (your code) to be run, you must register it in the `createHandler` in the `api/code/graphql/src/index.ts` file.

```typescript api/code/graphql/src/index.ts
const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    // ... rest of plugins
    new ContextPlugin<PbContext>(async (context) => {
      context.pageBuilder.onBeforePageCreate.subscribe(async ({ page }) => {
        // do your magic here
      })
    }),
  ],
})
```

<Alert type="warning">

Please, be aware that the order of subscribing matters, so if you want some event subscription to be executed before some other one, add it first.

</Alert>
