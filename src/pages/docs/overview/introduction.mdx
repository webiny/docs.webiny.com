Welcome! 👋

Webiny is an open-source content management system designed for enterprises. It's built on top of the serverless infrastructure to enable great scalability and site reliability even in the most demanding periods.

Webiny stands out from the crowd with its unique feature set, architecture, and open-source community. In the following few sections, you'll get to know Webiny, what it can do, and how to best use it to its full advantage.

## Our mission

A bit of a back story about Webiny: the founding team behind the project was running a web agency for over ten years. In that time, we worked with pretty much every CMS under the sun. We were annoyed by the limitations and poor experience of the existing offering.

The self-hosted enterprise CMS solutions were black boxes that were immensely hard to scale, manage and maintain. The SaaS offerings ultimately dictated how we ought to build our products. We didn't have any customization ability and had to give away the control over how and where our data gets stored and delivered.

With that in mind, we set on a path to build a new kind of CMS.

**Open-source is at our core;** Webiny is a CMS you can customize and embed deeply into existing solutions. Hooks, lifecycle events and plugins give you complete control to adapt the platform to your needs.

**Self-hosted**; we believe your data should be under your control. In addition to the CMS, Webiny also gives you the tools and processes to effectively manage and scale your instance.

**Serverless is the next step in the evolution of infrastructure**. It unlocks both scale and reliability at a lower price point. Long gone are days of being afraid of peak events and flash crowds.

**No-code, low-code, and code-code** :) Webiny empowers both developers and non-technical users to create amazing websites and solutions.
