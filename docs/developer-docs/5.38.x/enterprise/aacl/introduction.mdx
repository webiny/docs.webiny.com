## The Three Tiers of Webiny's Security Layer

Webiny's security layer divided into three tiers. The higher the tier, the more features are available.

All Webiny project start with the **Open Source** tier. The tier is free to use, but is limited when it comes to defining fine-grained permissions, allowing only the **No Access** and **Full Access** to be selected when defining permissions for individual Webiny apps.

Trying to select **Custom Access** will result in an alert message being shown, informing the user that the feature is only available with the Advanced Access Control Layer (AACL), which is available on the **Business** and **Enterprise** tiers.

To upgrade to **Business** tier, users [link their project](/docs/{version}/wcp/link-a-project) with [Webiny Control Panel (WCP)](/docs/{version}/wcp/overview), from where they can activate the Advanced Access Control Layer (AACL) for their project. By doing this, users will be able to define fine-grained permissions for individual Webiny apps.

Finally, for the most advanced use cases, users can upgrade to the **Enterprise** tier. On top of the features available with the first two tiers, the Enterprise tier introduces **Teams** and **Folder Level Permissions**.
