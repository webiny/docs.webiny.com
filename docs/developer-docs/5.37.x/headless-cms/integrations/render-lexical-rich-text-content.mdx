  - how to render rich text content from Headless CMS in a custom React app
</WhatYouWillLearn>

## Overview

One of the commonly used field types in Headless CMS content models is the Rich Text field. This field uses [Lexical Rich Text Editor](https://playground.lexical.dev/) to allow users to quickly create nicely formatted rich text content.

In this article we cover the steps to render the Headless CMS rich text content by using our React component
`<RichTextLexicalRenderer/>`, provided by the `@webiny/react-rich-text-lexical-renderer` package.

# Usage

Rendering of rich text content from Headless CMS consists of the following three steps:

1. Install the `@webiny/react-rich-text-lexical-renderer` package.
2. Add Webiny theme styles to your project.
3. Mount the `RichTextLexicalRenderer` component.

### 1. Installation

In your React app, install the following NPM package:

```
npm install --save @webiny/react-rich-text-lexical-renderer
```

Or if you prefer Yarn:

```
yarn add @webiny/react-rich-text-lexical-renderer
```

### 2. Add Webiny Theme Styles To Your Project

To use the same theme styles that are configured in your Webiny project, copy the `apps/theme/theme.ts` file into your React app.

### 3. Mount the component and Render the CMS Content

Now you need to import and mount the `<RichTextLexicalRenderer />` component in your app, and pass the rich text content, and optionally theme styles.

Note that in this code sample we do not include the code to load the data from the API. Instead,
we use the imaginary `useCmsContent()` hook to show where the content _could_ come from.

```tsx HomePage.tsx
import React from "react";
import { RichTextLexicalRenderer } from "@webiny/react-rich-text-lexical-renderer";
import { useCmsContent } from "../myWebinyGraphqlHooks/useCmsContent";
import { theme } from "../myWebinyTheme/theme";

export const HomePage = () => {
  // Fetch rich text content from the Headless CMS GraphQLQ API.
  const { content } = useCmsContent();

  return <RichTextLexicalRenderer value={content} theme={theme} />;
};
```
