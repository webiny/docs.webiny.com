  - what extensions are and how they can be used to extend Webiny's functionality.

</WhatYouWillLearn>

## Overview

One of the most powerful features of Webiny is the ability to extend the default functionality. This is done by creating and registering **extensions**. Extensions are a way to add new functionality to the system, or to modify the existing one.

There are a couple of types of extensions in Webiny, but the most common ones are:

- **Admin** - used to extend the Webiny's Admin app
- **API** - used to extend Webiny's backend API
- **Cloud Infrastructure** - used to extend the cloud infrastructure Webiny deploys

For example, via an Admin extension, we can change the [layout of the dashboard](/docs/admin-area/extending/custom-dashboard) or [change the logo](/docs/admin-area/extending/change-logo) that's shown in the header and the main menu. On the other hand, via an API extension, we can introduce new GraphQL queries or mutations, [content models](/docs/headless-cms/extending/content-models-via-code), or [hook into lifecycle events](/docs/headless-cms/references/lifecycle-events).

## Getting Started

In general, the easiest way to start working on a new extension is by using the **New Extension** scaffold, which can be accessed via the `webiny scaffold` command:

```bash
yarn webiny scaffold
```

Once run and the **New Extension** scaffold is selected, users are prompted to provide the basic information about the extension, like extension type and name.

Ultimately, the scaffold creates the base code for the extension in the `extensions` folder, which is the place where most of the extension development happens.

   There are a couple of cases where the extension code is placed outside of the `extensions` folder. For example, when [modifying cloud infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/basics/modify-cloud-infrastructure), the code is placed in different `webiny.application.ts` files, located in the `apps` folder.
