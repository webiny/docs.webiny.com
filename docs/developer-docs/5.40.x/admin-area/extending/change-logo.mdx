- how to replace the default Webiny logo with your own React component

</Alert>

## Overview

In this article, we cover how to replace the default Webiny logo that is shown in the Admin app's header bar and the navigation drawer, with our own logo.

<ExtensionsGettingStarted
  type={"admin"}
  name={"adminLogo"}
  dependencies={"@webiny/app-serverless-cms"}
  fullExampleLink={"https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/admin-logo"}
  fullExampleDownloadLink={"admin-logo"}
/>

## Replace the Logo

To replace the logo, in the `extensions/adminLogo/src/index.tsx` file, we place the following code:

```tsx extensions/adminLogo/src/index.tsx
import React from "react";
import { AddLogo } from "@webiny/app-serverless-cms";

import logoPng from "./logo.png";

export const Extension = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <AddLogo logo={<img src={logoPng} height={40} width={40} />} />
    </>
  );
};
```

As we can see, to replace the logo, we've utilized the `AddLogo` React component, which is provided by the `@webiny/app-serverless-cms` package. The `AddLogo` component accepts a `logo` prop, which is a React component that will be rendered in place of the default Webiny logo.

For this example, we've used the `logo.png` file, which is located in the same directory as the `index.tsx` file. We can replace it with your own logo.

With this code in place, in the Admin app, the default Webiny logo will be replaced with the logo you've provided.

<Image src={customLogoSame} alt="Different Logos In Header Bar and Navigation Drawer" />

## Using Different Logos

In some cases, you might want to provide different logos for the header bar and the navigation drawer, for example:

<Image src={customLogo} alt="Different Logos In Header Bar and Navigation Drawer" />

To achieve this, we can use the `useTags` hook, which is also provided by the `@webiny/app-serverless-cms` package:

```tsx extensions/adminLogo/src/index.tsx
import React from "react";
import { AddLogo, useTags } from "@webiny/app-serverless-cms";

// Import your logo image
import logoPng from "./logo.png";
import logoNavigationPng from "./logo-navigation.png";

const MyLogo = () => {
  // Fetch tags from context.
  const { location } = useTags();

  // "location" is a tag with a value of "navigation", if your
  // logo is currently being rendered inside the navigation drawer.
  if (location === "navigation") {
    return <img src={logoNavigationPng} height={50} width={100} />;
  }

  return <img src={logoPng} height={40} width={40} />;
};

export const Extension = () => (
  <>
    <AddLogo logo={<MyLogo />} />
  </>
);
```

As we can see, this time, we've created a new `MyLogo` component, which uses the `useTags` hook to determine whether the logo is being rendered in the header bar or the navigation drawer. If the logo is being rendered in the navigation drawer, we return the `logoNavigationPng` image; otherwise, we return the `logoPng` image.
