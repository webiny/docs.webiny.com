- how to replace the default Webiny dashboard

</WhatYouWillLearn>

## Overview

In this article, we show how we can replace the default dashboard in the Webiny Admin app. This is useful when we want to create a custom dashboard that better suits our needs.

<ExtensionsGettingStarted
  type={"admin"}
  name={"adminDashboard"}
  dependencies={"@webiny/app-serverless-cms"}
  fullExampleLink={"https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/custom-dashboard"}
/>

## Replacing the Default Dashboard

To replace the dashboard, in the `extensions/adminDashboard/src/index.tsx` file, we place the following code:

```tsx extensions/adminDashboard/src/index.tsx
import React from "react";
import { Dashboard, useSecurity } from "@webiny/app-serverless-cms";

// We create a new decorator called MyDashboard
const MyDashboard = Dashboard.createDecorator(() => {
  return function MyDashboard() {
    const { identity } = useSecurity();

    return (
      <div style={{ padding: 50, textAlign: "center" }}>
        <h3>Hi, {identity?.displayName}!</h3>
      </div>
    );
  };
});

export const Extension = () => (
  <>
    <MyDashboard />
  </>
);
```

As we can see, we first define the `MyDashboard` React component, which is actually the decorated version of the original `Dashboard` component, imported from the `@webiny/app-serverless-cms` package.

Note that, when we say decorated, we basically mean that the component has been wrapped with another component, which ultimately affects the functionality of the wrapped component, or, the decoratee.

In our case, we are replacing the default `Dashboard` component that renders the default dashboard, with our own, which just renders a simple greeting message.

To retrieve the currently logged in Admin user, we've also used the `useSecurity` React hook. As we can see, the hook lets us easily retrieve the currently logged-in identity, whose name weâ€™re displaying on our custom dashboard.
