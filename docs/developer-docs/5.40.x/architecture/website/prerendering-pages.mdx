- how the Prerendering Service (located in the **API** project application) utilizes **Website**'s cloud infrastructure resources in order to prerender your public website's pages and store their HTML and relevant metadata

## Diagram

<Alert type="info">

For brevity, the diagram doesn't include network-level cloud infrastructure resources, like region, VPC, availability zones, and so on. Check out the [Deployment Modes](/docs/{version}/architecture/deployment-modes/introduction) section if you're interested in that aspect of the deployed cloud infrastructure.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

Note that the Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon OpenSearch databases are deployed as part of the [Core](/docs/{version}/architecture/core/overview) project application. Also, the GraphQL Handler AWS Lambda function is deployed as part of the [API](/docs/{version}/architecture/api/overview) project application

These are still included in the diagram, just so it's more clear to the reader.

## Description

The diagram shows the process of prerendering pages published with the Page Builder application. Note the process also involves **Core** and **API** project applications.

<Alert type="info">

To learn more about the **Core** and **API** project applications' cloud infrastructure, check out the [Core](/docs/{version}/architecture/core/overview) and [API](/docs/{version}/architecture/api/overview) sections.

The flow consists of the following seven steps:

1. A user first publishes a page from the Admin Area. This is a simple GraphQL request, issued by the browser, to the GraphQL API that's deployed as part of the **API** project application <diagram-letter>I</diagram-letter>.
2. In the process, an Amazon EventBridge <diagram-letter>H</diagram-letter> event is emitted, which will be handled by the Subscribe <diagram-letter>E3</diagram-letter> AWS Lambda function.
3. The Subscribe <diagram-letter>E3</diagram-letter> AWS Lambda function creates one or more Amazon SQS messages.
4. Messages will be picked up by the Render <diagram-letter>E2</diagram-letter> AWS Lambda function, which is responsible for actual prerendering of pages. The process starts by issuing an HTTP request to the Amazon CloudFront distribution <diagram-letter>D</diagram-letter>.
5. The request is forwarded to the Amazon S3 bucket <diagram-letter>C</diagram-letter>. This is where the actual React application is hosted, with all of its code and static assets.
6. The mentioned Subscribe <diagram-letter>E3</diagram-letter> AWS Lambda function waits until the React application, served back via the Amazon CloudFront distribution <diagram-letter>D</diagram-letter>, has been completely rendered.
7. Finally, the function stores the generated HTML and related metadata in the Amazon S3 bucket <diagram-letter>B</diagram-letter>. Additional metadata also gets stored in the Amazon DynamoDB <diagram-letter>G</diagram-letter> that's part of the **Core** project application.

With these steps completed, the page is ready to be served to actual website visitors. Continue reading the [Serving Pages](/docs/{version}/architecture/website/serving-pages) section to learn more.
