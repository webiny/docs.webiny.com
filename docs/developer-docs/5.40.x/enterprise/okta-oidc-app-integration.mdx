## OIDC App Integration

To create an OIDC app integration, navigate to **Applications -> Applications**, and click the **Create App Integration** button:

<Image src={createApp1} />

For **Sign-in method**, select **OIDC - OpenID Connect**. For **Application type**, select **Single-Page Application**, since we'll communicate with this OIDC app from Webiny Admin app, which is a regular React single-page app. Then click **Next**.

<Image src={createApp2} />

The following image shows the general configuration of your OIDC app, with the most important parameters highlighted in red. Use this as a starting point, to get your integration working end to end. Then you can go back and tweak parameters to your liking.

## Map Okta Groups to Webiny Roles

Once you have the app integration in place, you need to set up a connection between Okta users, and Webiny roles. In this example, we'll be assigning users to Okta groups, and by doing that we want those users to automatically have certain application rights within Webiny.

To establish this connection, we need to do several things:

- add a custom attribute to the OIDC app

- assign Okta group(s) to the OIDC app

- map the custom attribute to the `idToken` claim, in the Okta authorization server

- map the `idToken` claim to Webiny identity in Webiny project

### Add a custom app attribute

Navigate to **Directory -> Profile Editor**, find your OIDC app profile, and click it (click the profile name, not the "Mappings", it's a different thing).

<Image src={mapGroups1} />

In the **Profile Editor** screen, click the **Add Attribute** button.

<Image src={mapGroups2} />

The important configuration parameters are highlighted in red. **Variable name** will be used to map this attribute value to the `idToken` claim. For **Attribute members**, it's recommended to use enumerated list of values, to reduce the possibility of invalid mappings. Lastly, the **Attribute type** must be set to **Group**, to have this attribute be mapped when assigning Okta groups to the OIDC app.

<Image src={mapGroups3} />

<Alert type="info" title="What are the values I need to use in the enum?">

The value of roles are actually role _slugs_, taken from the Webiny Admin app. To manage Webiny Roles, navigate to **Settings -> Access Management -> Roles** in your Webiny Admin app.

### Assign Okta groups to the OIDC app

Now you need to assign your Okta groups to the OIDC app. Navigate to **Directory -> Groups**. Here you'll find a list of all Okta groups. If you haven't already, create the desired user groups. Each user group will map to one of the Webiny roles in Webiny.

Find a group you want to assign to your app, and edit it (click the group name).

<Image src={mapGroups4} />

Navigate to the **Applications** tab, and click **Assign Applications**.

<Image src={mapGroups5} />

In the dialog, a list of applications is shown. Select the application you want to assign to the group by clicking the **Assign** button.

<Image src={mapGroups6} />

Okta will ask you to map the **Webiny Role** custom attribute we defined earlier. Select one of the predefined Webiny roles. All the users assigned to this Okta group, will automatically assume that particular Webiny role when accessing Webiny.

<Image src={mapGroups7} />

### Map Attribute to Token Claim

When the user logs into Okta, and navigates to Webiny Admin app, Webiny will use the user's `idToken` to communicate with the Webiny API. You need to pass the information about user's Okta group to Webiny, using a custom claim in the `idToken`.

In the Okta dashboard, Navigate to **Security -> API**, and access your desired authorization server.

<Image src={mapClaim1} />

Switch to the **Claims** tab, and click **Add Claim**.

<Image src={mapClaim2} />

Make sure your claim is included in **ID Token**. The `appuser.webiny_role` expression means that the value for the claim will come from the current user, using the `webiny_role` attribute value, which the user inherits from the Okta group he is assigned to.

<Image src={mapClaim3} />

### Test Your Configuration

To test whether the configuration is correct, you can use the **Token Preview** tab of the authorization server. Select your OIDC app, a grant type of **Authorization Code**, and a user you want to test with. You also need to select at least one scope to generate the token preview. The scopes used by the actual app are `openid`, `profile`, and `email`.

If everything is configured correctly, your `idToken` will contain a `webiny_role` claim, and its value will correspond to the **Webiny Role** custom attribute, which was assigned to the Okta group earlier.
