- how to customize file preview for specific types of files

</WhatYouWillLearn>

## Overview

In File Manager, every file has a preview that is shown to the user when browsing files. This preview is a small thumbnail that gives the user a quick overview of the file content. 

For example, in the following screenshot, we can see that the image file on the left has a small thumbnail immediately shown to the user. This makes it easier to quickly identity the file the user is looking for.

<Image src={fmFilesPreviews} title="Preview of Files" />

On the other hand, the video file on the right does not have any preview being displayed, simply because this functionality is not available out of the box.

But, if required, this can be implemented, which is what we cover in this article.

## File Preview For Specific File Type

In the following snippet of code, we show how we can introduce a custom file preview for `video/quicktime` file type.

```tsx extensions/customFilePreview/src/index.tsx
import React from "react";
import { FileManagerViewConfig, useFile } from "@webiny/app-file-manager";

// To make the code more readable, we immediately destructure child components.
const { Browser, FileDetails } = FileManagerViewConfig;

const VideoQtFileType = () => {
  // The `useFile` hook gives us access to the file that is being rendered.
  const { file } = useFile();
  return (
    <div>
      <p style={{ fontSize: 50 }}>üìΩÔ∏è</p>
      <br />
      <p>{file.name}</p>
      <p>{file.size} bytes</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export const createExtension = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <FileManagerViewConfig>
        {/* Ensures custom preview is applied in file browser (grid view). */}
        <Browser.Grid.Item.Thumbnail type={"video/quicktime"} element={<VideoQtFileType />} />

        {/* Ensures custom preview is applied in file details. */}
        <FileDetails.Preview.Thumbnail type={"video/quicktime"} element={<VideoQtFileType />} />
      </FileManagerViewConfig>
    </>
  );
};
```

With this code in place, the video file will now have a custom preview, both in the file browser (grid view) and in the file details panel.

<Image src={fmFilesPreviewsVideo} title="Custom Preview of a Video File - File Browser" />

<Image src={fmFilesPreviewsVideo2} title="Custom Preview of a Video File - File Details Panel" />

## Using Glob Patterns

It's worth pointing out that the `type` property of `Browser.Grid.Item.Thumbnail` and `FileDetails.Preview.Thumbnail` components also accepts a [glob](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>) pattern. This makes it easier to assign a custom file preview for multiple types of files.

In the following example, we're using `video/*` as the file type, in order to have our custom file preview being used for all video types of files.

```tsx
<FileManagerViewConfig>
  {/* Ensures custom preview is applied in file browser (grid view). */}
  <Browser.Grid.Item.Thumbnail type={"video/*"} element={<VideoQtFileType />} />

  {/* Ensures custom preview is applied in file details. */}
  <FileDetails.Preview.Thumbnail type={"video/*"} element={<VideoQtFileType />} />
</FileManagerViewConfig>
```

Internally, glob matching is performed using the [minimatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch) library.
