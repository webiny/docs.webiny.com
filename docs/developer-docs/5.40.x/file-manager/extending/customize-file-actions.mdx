## Overview

Files in File Manager can have different actions associated with them. These actions are displayed in the file browser (when hovering over a file) and file details panel.

On top of the built-in actions, it's also possible to add custom actions, which can be displayed for all files or only for specific file types. 

In this guide, we show how to add custom actions for all files and for specific file types.

## Global File Actions

Introducing a custom file action involves creating a React component that will be displayed as an action. This component is then added to the file browser and file details panel.

In the following code, we're adding a custom **Play Video** action that will be displayed for all types of files; both in the file browser (grid view) and file details panel.

```tsx extensions/customFileActions/src/index.tsx
import React from "react";
import { FileManagerViewConfig } from "@webiny/app-file-manager";
import { ReactComponent as PlayIcon } from "./video.svg";

// To make the code more readable, we immediately destructure child components.
const { Browser, FileDetails } = FileManagerViewConfig;

const PlayVideo = () => {
    return (
        <FileDetails.Action.IconButton
            label={"Play Video"}
            icon={<PlayIcon />}
            onAction={() => {
                alert("In the future, this will be useful.");
            }}
        />
    );
};

export const createExtension = () => {
    return (
        <>
            <FileManagerViewConfig>
                {/* Ensures custom is applied in file browser (grid view). */}
                <Browser.Grid.Item.Action name={"playVideo"} element={<PlayVideo />} />

                {/* Ensures custom preview is applied in file details. */}
                <FileDetails.Action name={"playVideo"} element={<PlayVideo />} />
            </FileManagerViewConfig>
        </>
    );
};
```

With this code in place, the **Play Video** action will be displayed for all files in the file browser (grid view) and file details panel.

## File Type Specific File Actions

Besides global actions, we can also introduce actions for specific file types. 

To ensure the action is only displayed for a specific file type, in the `PlayVideo` React component, we use the `useFile` hook to get the current file and check its `type` property. If the file type is not `video/quicktime`, we return `null` and the action is not displayed.

```diff-tsx extensions/customFileActions/src/index.tsx
import React from "react";
+ import { FileManagerViewConfig, useFile } from "@webiny/app-file-manager";
import { ReactComponent as PlayIcon } from "./video.svg";

// To make the code more readable, we immediately destructure child components.
const { Browser, FileDetails } = FileManagerViewConfig;

const PlayVideo = () => {
+   // Exit if the file type is not "video/quicktime".
+   const { file } = useFile();
+   if (file.type !== "video/quicktime") {
+       return null;
+   }
    
    return (
        <FileDetails.Action.IconButton
            label={"Play Video"}
            icon={<PlayIcon />}
            onAction={() => {
                alert("In the future, this will be useful.");
            }}
        />
    );
};

export const createExtension = () => {
    return (
        <>
            <FileManagerViewConfig>
                {/* Ensures custom is applied in file browser (grid view). */}
                <Browser.Grid.Item.Action name={"playVideo"} element={<PlayVideo />} />

                {/* Ensures custom preview is applied in file details. */}
                <FileDetails.Action name={"playVideo"} element={<PlayVideo />} />
            </FileManagerViewConfig>
        </>
    );
};
```
