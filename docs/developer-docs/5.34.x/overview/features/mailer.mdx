## About

Starting from 5.30.0 version of Webiny we have a mailer package (`@webiny/api-mailer`) via which you can send e-mails.

The package uses `transports` to send e-mails. The `transport` is an implementation of sending the e-mails, and we have few built-in ones.

## Available Transports

- Dummy Transport - does not send e-mails, just records them in an array which you can access later
- SMTP Transport - sends e-mails with the use of [nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) library

### Dummy Transport

A transport which pretends to be sending e-mails.

It is used for testing and as a backup in case no other transport exists or is not configured.

### SMTP Transport

A transport which sends e-mails via the [nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) library. It requires credentials to be defined, which we will go through.
If this transport fails to be created, it falls back to the `Dummy Transport`.

#### Basic Configuration Via Environment Variables

The simplest, and most rudimentary, configuration is done via the environment variables:

```dotenv
# required
WEBINY_MAILER_HOST=smtp.webiny.com
WEBINY_MAILER_PORT=25
WEBINY_MAILER_USER=root
WEBINY_MAILER_PASSWORD=password
WEBINY_MAILER_REPLY_TO=reply-to@webiny.com
# optional
WEBINY_MAILER_FROM=mailing-list@webiny.com
```

Variables `WEBINY_MAILER_HOST`, `WEBINY_MAILER_USER`, `WEBINY_MAILER_PASSWORD` and `WEBINY_MAILER_REPLY_TO` **must** be defined for SMTP Transport to work.

The `WEBINY_MAILER_FROM` variable is an optional one.

When applying the variables we run them through the validation process, so if any are invalid (for example, you do not put e-mail in `WEBINY_MAILER_FROM`), the creation process of the transport will fail.

<Alert type="info">
  When configuring transport via the environment variables, that configuration is used for all
  tenants in the system.
</Alert>

#### Basic Configuration Via Admin UI

Configuring `SMTP Transport` via the UI is the easiest way to configure the transport.

The "downside" is that, in multi-tenancy systems, you need to store configuration for each tenant.
If you do not want to do that, use the configuration via environment variables.

![Mailer Settings](./assets/mailer-settings.png)

<Alert type="warning">

Configuration via the UI is not available until you have the `WEBINY_MAILER_PASSWORD_SECRET` environment variable set.
Since we are storing the password in the database, we need to encrypt it. The `WEBINY_MAILER_PASSWORD_SECRET` is used as a secret in the `crypto-js` library's AES algorithm.

</Alert>

#### Advanced Configuration Via Code

The advanced configuration is done by creating your own SMTP Transport with custom config. You can use our `createSmtpMailer` method, you just need to pass the custom configuration.

```typescript
import { createTransport, createSmtpTransport } from "@webiny/api-mailer";

const transport = createTransport(async ({ settings, context }) => {
  return createSmtpTransport({
    ...settings,
    host: "my.changed.host",
    headers: {
      ["my-header"]: "value"
    }
    // ... or what ever you want to change in the SMTP Transport
  });
});

// register in your handler

const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    // existing plugins
    transport
  ]
});
```

When creating the transport via `createTransport`, you will get the `settings` and the `context` variables. The `settings` variable contains whatever was defined in either environment variables or the values which were stored via the Mailer Settings UI.

## Custom Transport

You can create your own transport if you do not like ours. You just need to use the `createTransport` method which returns the transport.

```typescript
import { createTransport } from "@webiny/api-mailer";

const transport = createTransport(async ({ settings, context }) => {
  return myOwnImplementationOfTheTransport({
    ...settings
  });
});

// register in your handler

const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    // existing plugins
    transport
  ]
});
```

## Usage

For example, let's say you want to send an e-mail when user creates an entry in the `Person` model.
You would want to subscribe to the `onEntryAfterCreate` event and send an e-mail only when added entry to that certain model.

```typescript
const plugin = new ContextPlugin<MailerContext>(async context => {
  context.cms.onEntryAfterCreate.subscribe(async ({ entry, model }) => {
    if (model.modelId !== "person") {
      return;
    }
    try {
      const response = await context.mailer.sendMail({
        to: ["me@test.local"],
        from: "webiny@test.local",
        subject: `A new entry in the ${model.name} model was created`,
        text: `A new entry in the ${model.name} was created. ID of the entry is ${entry.id}`,
        html: `<h2>A new entry in the ${model.name}</h2>
                  <p>Entry ID is ${entry.id}, url is ${createEntryUrl(entry)}</p>`
      });
      if (response.result) {
        return;
      } else if (!response.error) {
        console.log("E-mail was not sent, but there is no error in the response.");
        return;
      }
      console.log(response.error);
    } catch (ex) {
      console.log(ex.message);
    }
  });
});
```
