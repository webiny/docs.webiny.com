- what are the different properties of the theme object
- how to properly access the theme object in the code

</Alert>

## Overview

The theme object defines different visual aspects of our website, for example the default set of colors, typography, breakpoints, and more.

Apart from being used in the code by different page elements, the theme object is also integrated with different editors that are available in the Page Builder's application, like page or block editor.

For example, colors or different typography options defined in the theme object are automatically picked up by these editors, enabling users to select them while building content and ensuring everything stays visually consistent.

By default, the theme object is exported from the [`apps/theme/theme.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.35.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/theme/theme.ts) file, and it looks like the following:

```ts apps/theme/theme.ts
// Parts of code removed for brevity.
import { createTheme } from "@webiny/app-theme";
import { CSSObject } from "@emotion/react";

// Breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile).
export const breakpoints = {
  desktop: "@media (max-width: 4000px)",
  tablet: "@media (max-width: 991px)",
  "mobile-landscape": "@media (max-width: 767px)",
  "mobile-portrait": "@media (max-width: 478px)"
};

// Colors.
export const colors = {
  color1: "#fa5723", // Primary.
  color2: "#00ccb0", // Secondary.
  color3: "#0a0a0a", // Text primary.
  color4: "#616161", // Text secondary.
  color5: "#eaecec", // Background.
  color6: "#ffffff" // White background.
};

// Fonts.
export const fonts = {
  font1: "'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;", // Primary.
  font2: "'Lato', sans-serif;" // Secondary.
};

// Border radius.
export const borderRadius = 4;

// Typography.
// Code removed for brevity. Shown in the Typography section below.

// Buttons.
const buttons = (overrides: CSSObject) => ({
  // Code removed for brevity.
});

// Theme object.
const theme = createTheme({
  breakpoints,
  styles: {
    colors,
    typography,
    elements: {
      document: {
        a: { color: colors.color1 },
        b: { fontWeight: "bold" },
        i: { fontStyle: "italic" }
      },
      button: {
        default: buttons({ background: colors.color5, color: colors.color3 }),
        primary: buttons({ background: colors.color1, color: colors.color6 }),
        secondary: buttons({ background: colors.color2, color: colors.color6 }),
        outlinePrimary: buttons({
          border: `2px solid ${colors.color1}`,
          color: colors.color1
        }),
        outlineSecondary: buttons({
          border: `2px solid ${colors.color2}`,
          color: colors.color2
        }),
        simple: buttons({
          color: colors.color1,
          "&:hover": { transform: "translateY(-1px)" }
        })
      }
    }
  }
});

export default theme;
```

In the following text, we cover all the different properties of which the theme object consists of.

## Properties

### Breakpoints

Via the [`breakpoints`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.35.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/theme/theme.ts#L146) object, the theme object defines four available breakpoints:

1. desktop
2. tablet
3. mobile (landscape orientation)
4. mobile (portrait orientation)

Note that the property names of these breakpoints (`desktop`, `tablet`, `mobile-landscape`, `mobile-portrait`) should not be changed. But, the assigned media queries can be adjusted and new ones can be introduced, if need be.

### Colors

Via the [`styles.colors`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.35.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/theme/theme.ts#L148) object, the theme object defines theme colors, where property names represent the IDs of colors and values respective color codes.

The IDs of colors don't follow any naming convention. Upon introducing new colors, IDs like `primaryColor` or `myCustomColor` will work as well.

<Alert type="warning">
  Note that color IDs are used as references in pages created via the Page Builder's page editor.
  Meaning, changing them will cause existing pages (that are already relying on previous IDs) to
  break and not resolve the selected colors correctly.
</Alert>

### Typography

Via the [`styles.typography`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.35.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/theme/theme.ts#LL149C1-L149C1) object, the theme object defines theme typography. Unlike with breakpoints and colors, property names here represent the typography categories, and values array of different typography variants. For example, in the following code snippet, we can see six different heading variants being defined:

```ts apps/theme/theme.ts
// (...)

// Typography.
const headings = {
  fontFamily: fonts.font2,
  color: colors.color3,
  WebkitFontSmoothing: "antialiased"
};

const paragraphs = {
  fontFamily: fonts.font1,
  color: colors.color3,
  fontWeight: 400,
  lineHeight: 1.35,
  WebkitFontSmoothing: "antialiased"
};

export const typography = {
  // Six heading variants (levels of headings).
  headings: [
    {
      id: "heading1",
      name: "Heading 1",
      tag: "h1",
      styles: { ...headings, fontWeight: "bold", fontSize: 48 }
    },
    {
      id: "heading2",
      name: "Heading 2",
      tag: "h2",
      styles: { ...headings, fontSize: 36 }
    },
    {
      id: "heading3",
      name: "Heading 3",
      tag: "h3",
      styles: { ...headings, fontSize: 30 }
    },
    {
      id: "heading4",
      name: "Heading 4",
      tag: "h4",
      styles: { ...headings, fontSize: 24 }
    },
    {
      id: "heading5",
      name: "Heading 5",
      tag: "h5",
      styles: { ...headings, fontSize: 20 }
    },
    {
      id: "heading6",
      name: "Heading 6",
      tag: "h6",
      styles: { ...headings, fontSize: 18, lineHeight: "1.75rem" }
    }
  ]
  // Below we have three more typography categories: paragraphs, quotes, and lists.
};

// (...)
```

Every typography variant consists of the following properties:

| Property | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`     | A unique ID of the typography variant. Like with colors, typography IDs don't follow any naming convention. Upon introducing new typography, IDs like `primaryTypography` or `myCustomTypography` will work as well. |
| `name`   | A human-readable name of the typography variant. Will be shown in different Page Builder editors like page or block editor.                                                                                          |
| `tag`    | A HTML tag that will be used to render the typography variant.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `styles` | A CSS object that defines the visual appearance of the typography variant.                                                                                                                                           |

<Alert type="warning">
  Note that typography variant IDs are used as references in pages created via the Page Builder's
  page editor. Meaning, changing them will cause existing pages (that are already relying on
  previous IDs) to break and not resolve the selected typography correctly.
</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

Note that, when accessing the theme object and different typography variants, to make it easier, we can leverage the
special `stylesById` getter function. More on this below, in the [Accessing the Theme
Object](#accessing-the-theme-object) section.

</Alert>

### Page Elements

Respectively, the [`styles.elements`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.35.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/theme/theme.ts#L150) object enables defining and overriding styles for new and existing page elements. Like with colors and typography, property names represent the IDs of page elements, and values respective CSS rules that define them visually.

By default, the property contains styles for default [`document`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.35.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/theme/theme.ts#L151-L155) and [`button`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.35.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/theme/theme.ts#L163-L179) page elements, but note that styles for custom ones can be added here as well.

<Alert type={"info"}>
  Although page elements can have their styles defined within one or more respective React
  components, in multi-theme projects, having all or just part of the element's styles defined here
  can make it easier to have different styles for different themes.
</Alert>

<Alert type={"info"}>

To learn more about custom page elements, check out the existing [Create a Custom Page Element](/docs/{version}/page-builder/extending/create-a-page-element)
article.

</Alert>

## Accessing the Theme Object

While styling [page layouts](/docs/{version}/page-builder/theming/page-layouts) or [custom page elements](/docs/{version}/page-builder/extending/create-a-page-element), the theme object can be accessed in order to use the styling rules defined in it. To access the theme object, we rely on Emotion's suggested approach, which is through the React context.

The easiest way to access the theme object is via [styled components](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled), like in the following example:

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import styled from "@emotion/styled";

const SomeDiv = styled.div`
  background-color: ${props => props.theme.styles.colors["color5"]};
  height: 100px;
`;
```

As we can see, the `theme` object is available via the `props` argument of the styled component's template literal function. This means that we can access any of the theme object's properties, like `styles.colors`, `styles.typography` or `styles.elements`.

<Alert type="warning">

Note that the theme object should not be accessed by directly importing the [`apps/theme/theme.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.35.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/theme/theme.ts) file. This can
lead to issues in multi-theme projects, where the theme object is not the same for all themes.

</Alert>

<Alert type={"info"}>

Multiple examples of accessing the theme object can be found in the **Static page** page layout code that's included by default in all new projects. The code is located in the [`apps/theme/layouts/pages`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.35.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/theme/layouts/pages) code folder.

More information on page layouts can be found in the following [Page Layouts](/docs/{version}/page-builder/theming/page-layouts) article.

</Alert>

### Accessing Typography Variants

When accessing typography variants, we can leverage the special `stylesById` getter function, like in the following example:

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import styled from "@emotion/styled";

const SomeDiv = styled.div`
  ${props => props.theme.styles.typography.paragraphs.stylesById("paragraph1")};
  height: 100px;
  width: 200px;
`;
```

As we can see, the `stylesById` getter function accepts a typography variant ID as an argument, and returns a CSS object that defines the visual appearance of the typography variant. This way, we can easily access different typography variants, without having to manually traverse the `styles.typography` object.

### Custom Page Elements

If needed, theme object can also be accessed when creating [custom page elements](/docs/{version}/page-builder/extending/create-a-page-element), via the `useRenderer` React hook. For example:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { createRenderer } from "~/createRenderer";
import { useRenderer } from "~/hooks/useRenderer";

export type CustomPageElementRenderer = ReturnType<typeof createCustomPageElement>;

export const createCustomPageElement = () => {
  return createRenderer(() => {
    // Accessing the theme object via the useRenderer hook.
    const { theme } = useRenderer();

    return (
      // Using color1 from the theme object.
      <div style={{ color: theme.styles.colors["color1"] }}>Custom page element.</div>
    );
  });
};
```

<Alert type={"info"}>

Most often, styles for custom page elements are introduced via one or more standalone [Emotion styled components](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled).

</Alert>

## Responsive Styles

The theme object allows users to define responsive styles for all of the above mentioned properties. Consider the following example:

```diff-ts apps/theme/theme.ts
// ...

export const breakpoints = {
  desktop: "@media (max-width: 4000px)",
  tablet: "@media (max-width: 991px)",
  "mobile-landscape": "@media (max-width: 767px)",
  "mobile-portrait": "@media (max-width: 478px)"
};

// ...

// Typography.
const headings = {
  fontFamily: fonts.font2,
  color: colors.color3,
  WebkitFontSmoothing: "antialiased"
};

export const typography = {
  // Six heading variants (levels of headings).
  headings: [
    {
      id: "heading1",
      name: "Heading 1",
      tag: "h1",
      styles: {
+       // Note the use of breakpoint keys (defined at the top of
+       // this file, via the `breakpoints` constant).
+       desktop: { ...headings, fontWeight: "bold", fontSize: 48 },
+       tablet: { fontSize: 36 },
+       "mobile-landscape": { fontSize: 24 },
+       "mobile-portrait": { fontSize: 20 }
      }
    },
    // ...
  ]
  // ...
};

// ...
```

In this example, we've defined responsive styles for the `heading1` typography variant. This means its styles will be different depending on the device's screen size. For `desktop`, the font size will be `48px`, for `tablet` it will be `36px`, for `mobile-landscape` it will be `24px`, and for `mobile-portrait` it will be `20px`.

Note the use of breakpoint names (like `desktop`, `tablet`, etc.) instead of breakpoint values (like `@media (max-width: 4000px)`). This is because the theme object automatically converts breakpoint names to breakpoint values, based on the `breakpoints` constant defined at the top of the [`apps/theme/theme.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.35.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/theme/theme.ts#L5) file (and assigned via the [`breakpoints`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/theme/theme.ts#L147) property in the exported theme object).

## FAQ

### When defining custom theme, should I create a copy of the theme or can I just override the values I need?

In general, it depends on your needs and personal preference. There's nothing wrong with simply overriding the values you need.

### Is having multiple themes supported out of the box?

Out of the box, every Webiny project starts with a single theme (the one located in the [`apps/theme`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.35.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/theme) folder. For a multi-theme setup, please take a look at the [Setup Theme Manager](/docs/{version}/enterprise/theme-manager) article.
