- how to intercept the request

## Introduction

In the `5.34.0` version we added a possibility for users to intercept the Fastify request in it's initial phase.
It can be done via the [`HandlerOnRequestPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/16af8737377a9ae1dd6ac4ecffec5625726c814e/packages/handler/src/plugins/HandlerOnRequestPlugin.ts).

With this plugin you can do anything with the Fastify's [Request](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Request/) object, even stop the request from being processed.
To find out why you can stop the request from being processed, read about it in the [Fastify Lifecycle](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Lifecycle/) and [Fastify Hooks](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Hooks/) documentation.

## Creating and Registering the Plugin To Intercept the Request

```typescript
import { createHandlerOnRequest } from "@webiny/handler";

const handlerOnRequestPlugin = createHandlerOnRequest(async (request, reply) => {
  if (request.raw.path === "/testing") {
    // do something for this path
  }
});
```

Of course, as with our other plugins, you must register it in the Lambda handler plugins array:

```typescript apps/api/graphql/src/index.ts
const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    // ... other plugins
    handlerOnRequestPlugin
  ]
});
```

## Intercepting the `OPTIONS` Request and Stopping the Request From Being Processed

By default, Webiny intercepts the `OPTIONS` request and stop all of the Fastify lifecycles, after the `onRequest`, from being ran.
We do this because we have no need to run all the code we usually run for, eg., `POST` request.
You can see the code [here](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/16af8737377a9ae1dd6ac4ecffec5625726c814e/packages/handler/src/fastify.ts#L283).

Via the `HandlerOnRequestPlugin`, users can prevent our default behavior.

### Why Would the User Prevent the Webiny Default Behavior?

The most simple answer would be: to output their own headers in the `OPTIONS` request.

### How Can Users Prevent the Webiny Default Behavior on `OPTIONS` Request To Be Executed?

To prevent the Webiny default behavior on `OPTIONS` request, user would need to add a simple plugin which returns `false` as the result.

Here is an example of sending a custom header `myCustomHeader`, and prevent the Webiny default behavior, on `OPTIONS` request:

```typescript
import { createHandlerOnRequest } from "@webiny/handler";

const handlerOnRequestPlugin = createHandlerOnRequest(async (request, reply) => {
  if (request.method !== "OPTIONS") {
    return;
  }
  reply
    .code(204)
    .headers({
      myCustomHeader: "sending the custom headers"
    })
    /**
     * There must be some output or the request will hang.
     * Also, send must be just before the hijack(), otherwise all other method calls will not have any effect.
     */
    .send("")
    /**
     * It is important to hijack() the reply, as it prevents all other Fastify lifecycle events to be executed.
     * Of course, if user wants all the events to be triggered, they should not hijack() the reply.
     */
    .hijack();
  /**
   * It is important to return false in the end because it actually prevents
   * all other HandlerOnRequestPlugin to be ran, including the Webiny default behavior.
   */
  return false;
});
```

## Conclusion

Simply, with the `HandlerOnRequestPlugin` user can, in the initial stage of the Fastify Request Lifecycle:

- intercept the request and prevent it to go further down the lifecycle line
- modify the Webiny default `OPTIONS` headers output to suit their own need
- log the request to some outside service

Users must be careful on which path are they when executing the plugin code. Webiny has two built-in paths: `/cms` and `/graphql`.
