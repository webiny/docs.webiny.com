- how to integrate Tailwind CSS in your Webiny project

</Alert>

## Overview

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a popular utility-first CSS framework.
It allows us to quickly build user interfaces with the help of a plethora of built-in CSS classes and without ever leaving our HTML.

In this guide, we show how you can integrate Tailwind CSS into your Webiny project.

<Alert type="info">

The code that we will cover in this guide can also be found in our GitHub [examples repository](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/integrate-tailwind-css).

</Alert>

## Setting Up Tailwind CSS

### Install Tailwind CSS via Yarn

Install `tailwindcss` package and its peer-dependencies using yarn, by running the following command from root of your project:

```
yarn add -D tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat@^2.1.2 postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9
```

<Alert type="info">

Webiny currently uses [Webpack 4](https://v4.webpack.js.org/) which doesn't support PostCSS 8 yet. So, we'll need to install the [Tailwind CSS v2.0 PostCSS 7 compatibility](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#post-css-7-compatibility-build) build for now as shown above.

</Alert>

### Add Tailwind CSS to Webpack Configuration

In this guide, we integrate Tailwind CSS with the React application that's located within the **Website** project application.
But, you can use the same approach for other Webiny applications or a custom application for that matter.

<Alert type="info">

Learn more about project applications and packages in the [Project Applications and Packages](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/project-organization/project-applications-and-packages) key topic.

</Alert>

We need to add the Tailwind CSS to the `postcss` plugins inside the Webpack configuration of the application.

Every package in a Webiny application has a `webiny.config.ts` file that exports the often used development-related commands.

In case of **Website** `(apps/website)`, it contains the following commands:

- `watch` to watch the application
- `build` to build the application

Let's take a brief look at the file content:

```js apps/website/code/webiny.config.ts
const { createWatchApp, createBuildApp } = require("@webiny/project-utils");
// Some code is removed for the sake of brevity.

module.exports = {
    commands: {
        async watch(options) {
            (...)

            // Starts local application development.
            const watch = createWatchApp({ cwd: __dirname });
            await watch(options);
        },
        async build(options) {
            (...)

            // Creates a production build of your application, ready to be deployed to
            // a hosting provider of your choice, for example Amazon S3.
            const build = createBuildApp({ cwd: __dirname });
            await build(options);
        }
    }
};
```

As we can see in the above file, we export an object with `commands.watch` and `commands.build` functions, where we use the `createWatchApp` and `createBuildApp` helper functions, imported from the `@webiny/project-utils` package.

Both functions accept the optional `overrides` property. This is where we'll assign the necessary Webpack overrides, by assigning a simple callback function to its `webpack` property.

```diff-js apps/website/code/webiny.config.ts
import { createWatchApp, createBuildApp } from "@webiny/project-utils";
// Some code is removed for the sake of brevity.

export default {
    commands: {
        async watch(options) {
            // (...)

            // Starts local application development.
            const watch = createWatchApp({
                cwd: __dirname,
+                overrides: {
+                    webpack(config) {
+                        return require("./applyTailwindToWebpack")(config);
+                    }
+                }
            });
            await watch(options);
        },
        async build(options, context) {
            // (...)

            // Creates a production build of your application, ready to be deployed to
            // a hosting provider of your choice, for example Amazon S3.
            const build = createBuildApp({
                cwd: __dirname,
+                overrides: {
+                    webpack(config) {
+                        return require("./applyTailwindToWebpack")(config);
+                    }
+                }
            });
            await build(options);
        }
    }
};
```

We use `overrides.webpack` to add Tailwind CSS in the Webpack configuration in both `createWatchApp` and `createBuildApp` commands.

<Alert type="info">

We made this change in both `createWatchApp` and `createBuildApp` commands so that we can use Tailwind CSS in both local development and deployed application.

</Alert>

The actual code responsible for making the required modifications to the Webpack configuration is inside the [`applyTailwindToWebpack`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/integrate-tailwind-css/code/applyTailwindToWebpack.js) file:

```js apps/website/code/applyTailwindToWebpack.js
const tailwindcss = require("tailwindcss");
const { traverseLoaders } = require("@webiny/project-utils");

/**
 * A helper function to modify Webpack config.
 */
module.exports = config => {
  /**
   * Traverse all loaders, find `postcss-loader`, and overwrite plugins.
   */
  traverseLoaders(config.module.rules, loader => {
    // `loader` can also be a string, so check for `.loader` property.
    if (loader.loader && loader.loader.includes("postcss-loader")) {
      loader.options.plugins = [...loader.options.plugins(), tailwindcss()];
    }
  });

  return config;
};
```

Here we export a helper function that modifies Webpack configuration.
It takes `config` as the single argument and returns the new configuration after making some modifications to it.

Inside that function, we use [`traverseLoaders`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/project-utils/traverseLoaders.js) helper function that we require from `@webiny/project-utils` package.
It traverses all the loaders defined in `modules.rules` property of the Webpack configuration and passes each one of them to your callback.
You can then apply your modifications. In our case, we add Tailwind CSS plugins to the [`postcss-loader`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/integrate-tailwind-css/code/applyTailwindToWebpack.js#L13).

Now that we have added Tailwind CSS to Webpack configuration, let's move on to the next step.

### Create Your Tailwind CSS Configuration File

Next, generate your `tailwind.config.js` file. From the root of your project run the following command:

```
npx tailwindcss init
```

<Alert type="info">

We have created the [`tailwind.config.js`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/integrate-tailwind-css/tailwind.config.js) file in the root of Webiny project so that we can share it across all Webiny applications,
for example, `apps/admin` and `apps/website`.

</Alert>

This creates a minimal [`tailwind.config.js`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/integrate-tailwind-css/tailwind.config.js) file at the root of your project:

```js tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'.
  theme: {
    extend: {}
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {}
  },
  plugins: []
};
```

<Alert type="info">

Learn more about configuring Tailwind in the [configuration documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration).

</Alert>

Now that we have this global configuration, let's use it in the **Website** `(apps/website)` React application by creating a `tailwind.config.js` file in `apps/website/code` directory as shown below:

```js apps/website/code/tailwind.config.js
// Import config from the project root.
module.exports = require("../../../tailwind.config");
```

### Include Tailwind CSS in Your SCSS

Now it's time to include the Tailwind CSS directives in your styles.
As most of the styles for Webiny applications are present in `apps/theme` package, we also include Tailwind CSS styles there.

Open the `apps/theme/styles.scss` file that exports all theme styles and use the `@tailwind` directive to include Tailwind CSS `base`, `components`, and `utilities` styles as shown below:

```scss apps/theme/styles.scss
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
(...)
```

Tailwind CSS swaps these directives out at build-time with all of the styles it generates based on your configured design system.

That's all! Now, when you start your **Website** `(apps/website)` React application locally, by running:

```
yarn webiny watch apps/website --env dev
```

Or build it (which happens automatically for you when you deploy your application using `webiny deploy` command):

```
yarn webiny deploy apps/website --env {environment}
```

Tailwind CSS is ready to use in your Webiny project.

### Use Tailwind CSS in Website

Now that we've completed the above steps, let's try adding an example section made with Tailwind CSS as shown below:

```tsx apps/website/code/src/ExampleMadeWithTailwindCSS.tsx
import React from "react";

const ExampleMadeWithTailiwindCSS = () => {
  return (
    <div className="mt-12 -mb-12 bg-gray-50">
      <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:py-16 lg:px-8 lg:flex lg:items-center lg:justify-between">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-4xl">
          <span className="block">Ready to dive in?</span>
          <span className="block text-purple-600">Start your free trial today.</span>
        </h2>
        <div className="mt-8 flex lg:mt-0 lg:flex-shrink-0">
          <div className="inline-flex rounded-md shadow">
            <a
              href="#"
              className="inline-flex items-center justify-center px-5 py-3 border border-transparent text-base font-medium rounded-md text-white bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700"
            >
              Get started
            </a>
          </div>
          <div className="ml-3 inline-flex rounded-md shadow">
            <a
              href="#"
              className="inline-flex items-center justify-center px-5 py-3 border border-transparent text-base font-medium rounded-md text-purple-600 bg-white hover:bg-indigo-50"
            >
              Learn more
            </a>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleMadeWithTailiwindCSS;
```

For demonstration purposes, let's render our newly created React component inside the `App` component:

```diff-tsx apps/website/code/src/App.tsx
import React from "react";
(...)
+ import ExampleMadeWithTailiwindCSS from "./ExampleMadeWithTailwindCSS";

export const App = () => (
    <ApolloProvider client={createApolloClient()}>
        <BrowserRouter basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}>
            <PageBuilderProvider>
+               <ExampleMadeWithTailiwindCSS />
                <Switch>
                    <Route path={"*"} component={Page} />
                </Switch>
            </PageBuilderProvider>
        </BrowserRouter>
    </ApolloProvider>
);

```

If we did everything correctly, at the top of the page, we should be able to see the new section we just created:

## FAQ

### Can I include Tailwind CSS directives in Website `(app/website)` React application directly?

Yes, you can include the directives directly in the main style file of your React application. For example,
you can directly add the directives to `(apps/website/code/src/App.scss)` file for the **Website** application.

We chose to include it in the `apps/theme` package for guide because it's being used in all React applications of a Webiny project. As a result, we don't have to include these directives in every React application.

### Why are we not using Webpack v5 in a Webiny project?

We are working on the [Webpack upgrade](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1590).
