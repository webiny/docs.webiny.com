AI Context: Private Model Example (headless-cms/examples/private-model.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Analyzed content model concepts and builder patterns
2. Examined access control and visibility requirements
3. Studied use cases for private/internal models
4. Reviewed model builder API from builder/model.mdx

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Provide a complete, practical example of creating a private model
- Explain what private models are and when to use them
- Show how to configure model access restrictions
- Include field definitions appropriate for private data
- Demonstrate integration with the builder API
- Include real-world use case (internal audit log, system configuration)

What is a Private Model:
- Not exposed in public APIs
- Used for internal system data
- No GraphQL API generation
- Backend-only access
- Administrative/system data

Example Use Cases:
- Audit logs
- System configuration
- Internal metrics
- User activity tracking
- System state management

Implementation Shown:
- Model builder configuration
- Private flag setting
- Field definitions for audit data
- Appropriate field types
- Access control considerations

Pattern Used:
- Model builder fluent API
- Field builder integration
- Configuration best practices
- Security considerations

What is a Private Model:
- Not exposed in public GraphQL APIs
- Backend-only access
- Used for internal/system data
- No automatic API generation
- Administrative access only

Use Cases:
- Audit logs (user actions, changes)
- System configuration (internal settings)
- Internal metrics (performance, usage)
- User activity tracking
- System state management
- Background job logs

Example Structure:
```typescript
import { ModelBuilder } from "@webiny/api-headless-cms";

const auditLogModel = new ModelBuilder()
    .id("auditLog")
    .name("Audit Log")
    .singularApiName("AuditLog")
    .pluralApiName("AuditLogs")
    .private(true) // Key setting
    .group("system")
    .field(/* timestamp */)
    .field(/* user */)
    .field(/* action */)
    .field(/* details */)
    .build();
```

Key Configuration:
- `.private(true)` - Makes model private
- Appropriate fields for internal data
- System/admin group assignment

Access Pattern:
- Available through backend context only
- Not in public GraphQL schema
- Direct CMS API access required

Security Considerations:
- No public exposure
- Backend validation still needed
- Access control at application level

Tone Guidelines:
- Explain what private models are
- Show practical use case (audit log)
- Complete example with appropriate fields
- Explain security implications
