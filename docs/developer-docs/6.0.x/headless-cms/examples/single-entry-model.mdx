## Overview

This example demonstrates how to create a single entry model and why would you use it or need it.

## Settings Model Builder

```typescript
import { ModelFactory } from "webiny/api/cms/model";
import { ListGroupsUseCase } from "webiny/api/cms/group";

class SettingsImpl implements ModelFactory.Interface {
    public constructor(private listGroupsUseCase: ListGroupsUseCase.Interface) {}

    public async execute(builder: ModelFactory.Builder): ModelFactory.Return {
        const groups = await this.listGroupsUseCase.execute();
        if (groups.isFail()) {
            throw new Error(`Could not load groups: ${groups.error.message}`);
        }
        const [group] = groups.value;

        if (!group) {
            throw new Error(`At least one group must exist to create models.`);
        }

        return [
            builder
                .public({
                  name: "Settings",
                  modelId: "settings",
                  group: group.slug,
                  singularApiName: "Setting",
                  pluralApiName: "Settings"
                })
                .singleEntry()
                .description("A model used to store settings.")
                .fields(fieldBuilder => {
                    return {
                        googleAnalytics: fieldBuilder
                            .text()
                            .label("Google Analytics")
                            .required(),
                        facebookPixel: fieldBuilder
                            .text()
                            .label("Facebook Pixel")
                    };
                })
        ];
    }
}

const Settings = ModelFactory.createImplementation({
    implementation: SettingsImpl,
    dependencies: [ListGroupsUseCase]
});

export default Settings;
```

## Usage Of the Defined Single Entry Model

The model we created will be used to store the settings of our application, and it will show in the Admin UI.

Since it's a single entry model, there will be only one entry of this model in the system.

Also, the entry stored via this model is available on both manage and read GraphQL API (completely public).
