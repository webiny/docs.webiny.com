AI Context: Headless CMS - About (headless-cms/about.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Analyzed all headless-cms documentation files created
2. Examined the architecture: models, groups, entries
3. Studied the builder, event handler, and use case patterns
4. Understood the overall CMS extension architecture

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Created overview document for the entire Headless CMS section
- Explained the three-tier architecture (models, groups, entries)
- Introduced the main extension points (builders, event handlers, use cases)
- Provided navigation to detailed documentation
- Made it accessible for developers new to extending the CMS
- Explained when and why to extend each component

Document Structure:
- Overview: What is extensible in Headless CMS
- What You'll Learn
- Architecture explanation (Models → Groups → Entries)
- Extension points:
  - Builders (define structure)
  - Event Handlers (react to changes)
  - Use Cases (custom business logic)
- Links to detailed documentation sections

Key Concepts:
- Content models define structure
- Groups organize models
- Entries are content instances
- Builders create definitions
- Event handlers add behavior
- Use cases implement custom logic

CMS Architecture (Three-Tier):
1. Groups - Organizational containers for models
2. Models - Content structure definitions (like database tables)
3. Entries - Content instances (like database rows)

Extension Points:
1. Builders - Programmatically define structure
   - GroupBuilder: Create groups
   - ModelBuilder: Create models
   - FieldBuilder: Define fields

2. Event Handlers - React to lifecycle events
   - Before/After Create, Update, Delete
   - Validation, authorization, side effects

3. Use Cases - Custom business logic
   - Override default behavior
   - Add custom operations
   - Implement workflows

Document Structure:
- Overview of extensibility
- What You'll Learn
- Architecture explanation (Groups → Models → Entries)
- Extension points overview
- Links to detailed documentation
