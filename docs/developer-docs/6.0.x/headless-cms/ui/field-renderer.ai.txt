AI Context: Field Renderer (headless-cms/ui/field-renderer.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Read and analyzed v6/packages/app-headless-cms/src/admin/plugins/fieldRenderers
2. Examined each renderer plugin's structure
3. Identified renderer.rendererName values
4. Analyzed renderer.canUse functions to determine field/renderer compatibility
5. Created a comprehensive list of field types and compatible renderers

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Document all available field renderers
- Show which renderers work with which field types
- Organize by field type with compatible renderers listed
- Note special configurations (e.g., settings.type for datetime)
- Group inputs by type (text, number, selection, etc.)
- Note multiple value support where applicable
- Use MDX formatting for clear presentation
- Avoid redundant phrasing (not mentioning "The system provides" repeatedly)

Field/Renderer Mapping Created:
- Text fields: text-input, textarea, slug, lexical-editor, markdown-editor, etc.
- Number fields: number-input, slider, radio-buttons, etc.
- Boolean fields: toggle, checkbox, radio-buttons, select-box
- Datetime fields: date-time-without-timezone, date-time-with-timezone, etc.
- Reference fields: ref-input-default, ref-input-list
- Object fields: object-input
- File fields: file-input

Special Notes Added:
- Multiple value renderers noted where applicable
- Datetime requires settings.type property
- Grouped inputs organized clearly
- Rich text editor options explained

Key Code Locations:
- Renderer plugins: v6/packages/app-headless-cms/src/admin/plugins/fieldRenderers
- Each plugin has: renderer.rendererName and renderer.canUse()
- Field types defined in field builder

How Information Was Gathered:
1. Read all renderer files in fieldRenderers directory
2. Extracted renderer.rendererName for identification
3. Analyzed renderer.canUse(field) to determine compatibility
4. Created mapping of field type → compatible renderers

Document Structure:
- Group by field type (text, number, boolean, etc.)
- List compatible renderers for each
- Note special requirements (e.g., settings.type for datetime)
- Indicate multiple value support with "(multiple values)" notation

Example Entry Format:
```
Text Fields
- text-input: Single line text input
- textarea: Multi-line text input
- text-input (multiple values): Multiple text values
```

Special Configurations:
- Datetime fields require settings.type property to be set
- Multiple value renderers noted with "(multiple values)"
- Reference fields have default and list variants

Common Patterns:
1. Organize by input type category
2. Keep descriptions concise
3. Don't repeat "The system provides" - user already knows context
4. Group related renderers together

Tone Guidelines:
- Concise and informative
- Focus on capabilities, not implementation
- Avoid redundant phrasing
- Let the list speak for itself
