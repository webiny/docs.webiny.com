AI Context: Entry Event Handlers (headless-cms/event-handler/entry.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Started with group.mdx and model.mdx event handler examples as templates
2. Analyzed GroupBeforeCreateEventHandler code example with logger
3. Adapted the pattern for entry-related events
4. Identified all entry lifecycle events (create, update, delete, publish, etc.)
5. Created consistent examples following the established pattern

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Follow the same structure as group/model event handlers
- Use logger in all examples (imported from @webiny/api/logger)
- Include validation and authorization examples
- Document all entry lifecycle events
- Show both before and after event handlers
- Include practical use cases for each event
- Use Result pattern for error handling
- Keep examples consistent and production-ready

Events Documented:
1. Before Create - Validation and authorization before entry creation
2. After Create - Post-creation actions (notifications, indexing)
3. Before Update - Validation before updates
4. After Update - Post-update actions
5. Before Delete - Authorization checks
6. After Delete - Cleanup operations
7. Before Publish - Validation before publishing
8. After Publish - Post-publish actions (cache invalidation, webhooks)
9. Before Unpublish - Pre-unpublish checks
10. After Unpublish - Post-unpublish cleanup

Pattern Used:
- Logger for debugging and monitoring
- Result pattern for error handling
- Clear handler naming convention
- Practical, real-world examples
- Type safety with TypeScript

Target Audience: Developers extending entry behavior, adding business rules, integrating with external systems.

- headless-cms/use-case/entry.mdx - Use case integration

Key Code Locations:
- Logger import: @webiny/api/logger
- Result import: @webiny/feature/api
- Event types: Check existing CMS type definitions

Required Imports in Every Example:
```typescript
import { logger } from "@webiny/api/logger";
import { Result } from "@webiny/feature/api";
```

Event Handler Structure to Follow:
```typescript
export const HandlerName = async (params) => {
    logger.info("Action description", { context });

    // Validation/business logic
    if (someCheck) {
        return Result.fail(new ErrorType("message"));
    }

    // Continue processing (return nothing or Result.ok())
};
```

Common Patterns:
1. Log at the start of each handler
2. Use Result.fail() to stop processing
3. Return nothing to continue
4. Include practical use cases (duplicate checks, authorization, notifications)
5. Name handlers clearly (EntryBeforeCreateEventHandler)

Tone Guidelines:
- Production-ready examples
- Explain when/why to use each event
- Include real-world scenarios
