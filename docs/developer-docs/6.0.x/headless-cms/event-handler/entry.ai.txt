AI Context: Entry Event Handlers (headless-cms/event-handler/entry.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Started with group.mdx and model.mdx event handler examples as templates
2. Analyzed GroupBeforeCreateEventHandler code example with logger
3. Adapted the pattern for entry-related events
4. Identified all entry lifecycle events (create, update, delete, publish, etc.)
5. Created consistent examples following the established pattern

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Follow the same structure as group/model event handlers
- Use logger in all examples (imported from @webiny/api/logger)
- Include validation and authorization examples
- Document all entry lifecycle events
- Show both before and after event handlers
- Include practical use cases for each event
- Use Result pattern for error handling
- Keep examples consistent and production-ready

Events Documented:
1. Before Create - Validation and authorization before entry creation
2. After Create - Post-creation actions (notifications, indexing)
3. Before Update - Validation before updates
4. After Update - Post-update actions
5. Before Delete - Authorization checks
6. After Delete - Cleanup operations
7. Before Publish - Validation before publishing
8. After Publish - Post-publish actions (cache invalidation, webhooks)
9. Before Unpublish - Pre-unpublish checks
10. After Unpublish - Post-unpublish cleanup

Pattern Used:
- Logger for debugging and monitoring
- Result pattern for error handling
- Clear handler naming convention
- Practical, real-world examples
- Type safety with TypeScript

Target Audience: Developers extending entry behavior, adding business rules, integrating with external systems.
