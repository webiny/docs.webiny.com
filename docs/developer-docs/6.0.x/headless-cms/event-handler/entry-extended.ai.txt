AI Context: Entry Extended Event Handlers (headless-cms/event-handler/entry-extended.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Built on top of entry.mdx event handlers
2. Added more advanced and specialized event handlers
3. Covered additional entry lifecycle events not in the basic document
4. Included revision management events
5. Added advanced validation and workflow examples

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Extend beyond basic CRUD events
- Document advanced entry management scenarios
- Include revision-related events
- Show complex validation patterns
- Demonstrate workflow integration
- Cover status transitions
- Include batch operation events
- Maintain consistency with entry.mdx patterns

Additional Events Documented:
1. Before Move - Validation before moving entry between models
2. After Move - Post-move cleanup
3. Before Create Revision - Revision creation validation
4. After Create Revision - Post-revision actions
5. Before Delete Revision - Pre-deletion checks
6. After Delete Revision - Cleanup after revision deletion
7. Status transition events
8. Batch operation hooks

Pattern Used:
- Same as entry.mdx (logger, Result pattern)
- More complex business logic examples
- Integration with external workflows
- Advanced validation scenarios

Purpose: Provide comprehensive coverage of all entry-related events for developers building advanced CMS extensions and custom workflows.

Additional Events Beyond Basic CRUD:
- Revision management (create, delete revisions)
- Entry moving (between models)
- Status transitions (draft → review → published)
- Batch operations
- Advanced workflow events

Extended Event Pattern (same as entry.mdx):
```typescript
import { logger } from "@webiny/api/logger";
import { Result } from "@webiny/feature/api";

export const EntryBeforeMoveEventHandler = async ({ entry, targetModel, context }) => {
    logger.info("Before moving entry", {
        entryId: entry.id,
        targetModel: targetModel.modelId
    });

    // Validate move is allowed
    if (!canMoveEntry(entry, targetModel)) {
        return Result.fail(new ValidationError("Entry cannot be moved to target model"));
    }
};
```

Extended Events to Document:
1. Before Move - Validation before moving entry between models
2. After Move - Post-move cleanup and updates
3. Before Create Revision - Revision creation validation
4. After Create Revision - Post-revision actions
5. Before Delete Revision - Pre-deletion checks
6. After Delete Revision - Cleanup after revision deletion
7. Status Transition - Custom workflow states
8. Batch Operations - Bulk entry processing

Advanced Use Cases:
- Multi-stage approval workflows
- Revision history management
- Content migration between models
- Bulk operations with validation
- Custom status transitions

Pattern Consistency:
- Same logger + Result pattern as entry.mdx
- More complex business logic
- Integration with external systems
- Workflow state management

Tone Guidelines:
- Advanced scenarios
- Complex validation examples
- Workflow integration patterns
- Maintain consistency with entry.mdx
