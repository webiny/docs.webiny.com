AI Context: Group Event Handlers (headless-cms/event-handler/group.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Analyzed GroupBeforeCreateEventHandler code example with logger provided by user
2. Followed the pattern established in that example
3. Identified all group lifecycle events
4. Created consistent examples for each event type
5. Used logger pattern throughout

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Use the GroupBeforeCreateEventHandler as the template
- Include logger in all examples (imported from @webiny/api/logger)
- Document before and after events for create, update, delete
- Show validation and authorization patterns
- Use Result pattern for error handling
- Keep examples practical and production-ready
- Maintain consistency across all event handlers

Events Documented:
1. Before Create - Validation and authorization before group creation
2. After Create - Post-creation actions (logging, notifications)
3. Before Update - Validation before updates
4. After Update - Post-update actions
5. Before Delete - Authorization and dependency checks
6. After Delete - Cleanup operations

Pattern Used (from user's example):
- Logger for debugging and monitoring
- Result pattern for validation failures
- Clear error messages
- Type-safe event handlers
- Practical use cases (duplicate checks, authorization, cleanup)

Example Structure:
- Import statements (logger from @webiny/api/logger)
- Handler function with typed parameters
- Logger info statements
- Business logic (validation, checks)
- Result.fail() for errors
- Return result or continue

Target Audience: Developers extending group behavior, adding custom validation, or integrating group management with external systems.
