AI Context: Model Event Handlers (headless-cms/event-handler/model.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Followed the pattern from group.mdx event handlers
2. Adapted for model-specific lifecycle events
3. Used the same logger and Result pattern approach
4. Identified model-specific validation scenarios
5. Included field validation examples

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Follow group.mdx structure and patterns
- Include logger in all examples
- Document model lifecycle events (create, update, delete)
- Show model-specific validations (field checks, naming conventions)
- Use Result pattern consistently
- Include practical examples (field validation, API name checks)
- Maintain consistency with other event handler docs

Events Documented:
1. Before Create - Validation before model creation (API names, field checks)
2. After Create - Post-creation actions (logging, initial setup)
3. Before Update - Validation before updates (breaking changes check)
4. After Update - Post-update actions (cache invalidation)
5. Before Delete - Authorization and dependency checks
6. After Delete - Cleanup operations (remove related data)

Pattern Used:
- Logger from @webiny/api/logger
- Result pattern for validation errors
- Model-specific validation logic
- Field structure validation
- API naming convention checks
- Dependency validation

Examples Include:
- Validating required fields are present
- Checking API name format
- Preventing breaking changes
- Verifying no entries exist before deletion
- Logging model changes

Target Audience: Developers extending model behavior, enforcing custom validation rules, or implementing model governance policies.
