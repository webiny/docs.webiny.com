AI Context: Field Builder (headless-cms/builder/field.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Examined field builder code in v6/packages/api-headless-cms/src/features/modelBuilder
2. Analyzed available field builder methods and options
3. Reviewed field type definitions and configuration
4. Studied the field settings and validation patterns
5. Cross-referenced with field-renderer.mdx for UI integration

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Document the field builder API comprehensively
- Show all available field methods
- Explain field types (text, number, boolean, datetime, object, ref, etc.)
- Detail configuration options (required, multiple values, validation)
- Include field settings (predefinedValues, renderer configuration)
- Link to field renderer documentation for UI customization
- Provide practical examples for each field type
- Explain when to use each field type

Field Types Documented:
1. Basic Types - text, longText, number, boolean
2. Date/Time - datetime with timezone support
3. Rich Content - richText
4. References - ref (model references)
5. Object - nested objects
6. File - file uploads

Field Configuration:
- Field ID and label
- Required validation
- Multiple values support
- Predefined values (select options)
- Custom validation rules
- Default values
- Help text
- Renderer settings for UI

Pattern Observed:
- Fluent API for field building
- Method chaining for configuration
- Type-safe field definitions
- Integration with UI renderers
- Validation at field level

Target Audience: Developers programmatically creating content models, need to understand field types and configuration options.
