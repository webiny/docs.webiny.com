## Overview

The Headless CMS is built around three core concepts: **Groups**, **Models**, and **Entries**. Groups organize related models, models define content structure, and entries are the actual content instances.

### Extension Points

You can extend the Headless CMS through three main approaches:

**Builders** - Programmatically define structure using:
- `GroupBuilder` - Create and organize model groups
- `ModelBuilder` - Define content models
- `FieldBuilder` - Configure model fields

**Event Handlers** - React to lifecycle events:
- Before/After Create, Update, Delete operations
- Validation and authorization hooks
- Custom business logic integration

**Use Cases** - Implement custom business logic:
- Override default behavior
- Add custom operations
- Implement complex workflows

For detailed documentation on each extension point, see the specific sections on [Builders](/docs/headless-cms/builder), [Event Handlers](/docs/headless-cms/event-handler), and [Use Cases](/docs/headless-cms/use-case).
