AI Context: GraphQL - Example (graphql/example.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Analyzed code example provided by user showing how Webiny implements GraphQL type resolvers and schema definition
2. Examined the factory pattern for type and resolver registration
3. Studied the integration between GraphQL types and business logic
4. Reviewed the modular approach to schema building

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Provide a complete, working example of GraphQL implementation
- Show both type definitions and resolver implementations
- Demonstrate the factory pattern in action
- Include query and mutation examples
- Show how to integrate with use cases/business logic
- Make it practical and copy-paste friendly
- Used a cohesive example (Book management system)

Example Structure:
1. Type Definitions - BookType with fields
2. Input Types - CreateBookInput for mutations
3. Query Resolvers - getBook, listBooks
4. Mutation Resolvers - createBook, updateBook
5. Integration with use cases

Pattern Demonstrated:
- factory.createObjectType() for types
- factory.createInputObjectType() for inputs
- factory.createResolver() for query/mutation logic
- Type-safe resolver implementations
- Integration with domain layer (use cases)
- Error handling with Result pattern

Tone: Practical and example-driven, showing how all pieces fit together. Verified to match the tone of reference.mdx (using "Webiny provides", explaining concepts consistently, maintaining technical accuracy).
