## Overview

This reference shows the basic structure of implementing a GraphQL Schema Factory. The `GraphQLSchemaFactory` interface provides two key methods: `addTypeDefs()` to define your GraphQL types, and `addResolver()` to handle the resolution logic. The resolver configuration requires specifying the path to the GraphQL type, any dependencies needed, and the resolver function itself.

## Code Example

```typescript
import { GraphQLSchemaFactory } from "webiny/api/graphql";

class GraphQLReference implements GraphQLSchemaFactory.Interface {
    public async execute(builder: GraphQLSchemaFactory.SchemaBuilder): GraphQLSchemaFactory.Return {
        builder.addTypeDefs(/* GraphQL */ `
            type MyCustomQuery {
                somePath: String
            }
        `);

        builder.addResolver({
            // path to target graphql schema type
            path: "MyCustomQuery.somePath",
            // an array containing all the dependencies required by the resolver
            dependencies: [],
            // function that returns the resolver function and receives the dependencies as arguments
            resolver: (...dependenciesInOrderTheyWereAssigned) => {
                return async ({parent, context, info, args}) => {
                    return "null";
                };
            }
        });

        return builder;
    }
}

export default GraphQLReference;

```
