AI Context: Dependency Injection (di.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Read the @webiny/di package README from the linked repository (https://github.com/webiny/di)
2. Analyzed the di-readme.md file that was provided in the 6.0.x folder
3. Examined existing examples in 6.0.x files to understand how abstractions and implementations are used in practice
4. Reviewed the CreateEntryUseCase abstraction example provided by the user, which showed:
   - How to use createAbstraction
   - Interface definition patterns
   - Namespace exports pattern
   - Error type definitions
   - Proper TypeScript typing

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Target audience: Developers who already understand DI/factory patterns
- Focus only on Webiny-specific implementation (createAbstraction, createImplementation)
- Keep examples simple and generic (Book/Author/Category domain)
- Show the namespace pattern used throughout Webiny codebase
- Export everything users need from the namespace (types, interfaces, errors)
- Demonstrate the Result pattern integration
- Use the prefix pattern for abstraction names (e.g., "Library/CreateBook")
- Did not include automatic discovery or advanced topics per user instruction
- Removed comments from example code except for pedagogical correct/wrong comparisons

Example Pattern Used:
- Interface definition
- Error types definition
- createAbstraction call
- Namespace export with all necessary types
- const export of the abstraction
- createImplementation usage from the namespace

The document structure follows the existing Webiny docs pattern with:
- Overview
- What You'll Learn
- Main content sections
- Code examples

Related Documents:
- See headless-cms/use-case/*.mdx for real-world abstraction examples
- See headless-cms/event-handler/*.mdx for implementation examples
- See basic/result.mdx for the Result pattern (used with DI)

Key Code Locations:
- @webiny/di package: https://github.com/webiny/di
- Example abstractions: remote/cms/entry/abstraction/* (symlinked)
- Example implementations: remote/cms/entry/useCase/* (symlinked)

Common Patterns to Follow:
1. Always export both namespace and const
2. Use Result pattern for error handling
3. Prefix abstraction names (e.g., "Cms/CreateEntry")
4. Export all types users need from namespace
5. Keep examples generic (avoid CMS-specific examples in this doc)

Tone Guidelines:
- Use "Webiny provides/uses/offers" not "We provide"
- Be concise and technical
- Target experienced developers
- Focus on what's unique to Webiny DI
