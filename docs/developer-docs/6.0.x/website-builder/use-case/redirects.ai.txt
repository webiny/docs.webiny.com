AI Context: Redirect Use Cases (website-builder/use-case/redirects.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Read symlinked remote folder to analyze redirect use case implementations
2. Examined redirect use cases (create, update, delete, get, list)
3. Studied redirect-specific business logic and validations
4. Followed the established use case pattern from CMS and pages documentation
5. Understood redirect management requirements

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Document all redirect-related use cases
- Follow the established use case pattern
- Show abstraction and implementation patterns
- Include redirect-specific validation logic
- Demonstrate URL pattern matching
- Cover CRUD operations
- Include error handling with Result pattern

Use Cases Documented:
1. Create Redirect - Create new redirects with validation
2. Update Redirect - Modify existing redirects
3. Delete Redirect - Remove redirects
4. Get Redirect - Retrieve single redirect
5. List Redirects - Query multiple redirects with filters

Pattern Used:
- Interface definition
- Error types (validation, authorization, repository errors)
- createAbstraction call
- Namespace export with all types
- createImplementation pattern
- Repository dependency injection
- Result pattern for error handling
- Redirect-specific validation (URL format, status codes, circular redirects)

Redirect-Specific Logic:
- Source URL validation
- Target URL validation
- HTTP status code validation (301, 302, 307, 308)
- Circular redirect detection
- Wildcard pattern validation
- Duplicate redirect prevention
- URL normalization

Verification Done:
- Analyzed redirect use case implementations from symlinked remote folder
- Verified method signatures and parameters
- Confirmed return types
- Validated business logic patterns
- Ensured consistency with actual implementations

Target Audience: Developers implementing custom redirect management logic, building redirect rules engines, or extending website builder redirect functionality.
