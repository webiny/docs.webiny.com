AI Context: Page Event Handlers (website-builder/event-handler/pages.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Read /Users/brunozoric/work/webiny/webiny-beta-test/testing-v6.0.0/extensions/websiteBuilder/pages/eventHandler
2. Analyzed existing page event handler implementations
3. Examined the event handler patterns (before/after create, update, delete, publish, unpublish)
4. Studied page-specific validation and business logic
5. Followed the pattern established in CMS event handlers

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Document all page lifecycle events
- Follow the established event handler pattern (logger, Result)
- Include page-specific validations (URL paths, SEO, templates)
- Show practical examples for each event type
- Demonstrate integration points
- Cover publishing workflow
- Include error handling patterns

Events Documented:
1. Before Create - Validation before page creation (URL validation, template checks)
2. After Create - Post-creation actions (indexing, cache warming)
3. Before Update - Validation before updates (URL conflicts, breaking changes)
4. After Update - Post-update actions (cache invalidation)
5. Before Delete - Authorization and dependency checks
6. After Delete - Cleanup operations (remove from index)
7. Before Publish - Pre-publish validation (required fields, SEO)
8. After Publish - Post-publish actions (CDN invalidation, sitemap update)
9. Before Unpublish - Pre-unpublish checks
10. After Unpublish - Post-unpublish cleanup

Pattern Used:
- Logger from @webiny/api/logger
- Result pattern for validation errors
- Page-specific validation logic
- URL path validation
- SEO checks
- Template validation
- Publishing workflow integration

Page-Specific Validations:
- URL path format and conflicts
- SEO metadata completeness
- Template existence
- Required field validation
- Publishing prerequisites

Target Audience: Developers extending page behavior, implementing custom publishing workflows, or integrating website builder with external systems.

Note: Website Builder replaced Page Builder and Form Builder per user correction.
