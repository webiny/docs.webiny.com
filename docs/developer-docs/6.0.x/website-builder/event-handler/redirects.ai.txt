AI Context: Redirect Event Handlers (website-builder/event-handler/redirects.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Read /Users/brunozoric/work/webiny/webiny-beta-test/testing-v6.0.0/extensions/websiteBuilder/redirects/eventHandler
2. Analyzed existing redirect event handler implementations
3. Examined redirect lifecycle events (create, update, delete)
4. Studied redirect-specific validation (URLs, status codes, patterns)
5. Followed the established event handler pattern

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Document all redirect lifecycle events
- Follow the established event handler pattern (logger, Result)
- Include redirect-specific validations (URL format, status codes, circular redirects)
- Show practical examples for each event type
- Demonstrate validation patterns
- Cover error handling

Events Documented:
1. Before Create - Validation before redirect creation (URL format, status code, circular redirect check)
2. After Create - Post-creation actions (cache invalidation, logging)
3. Before Update - Validation before updates (breaking changes, conflicts)
4. After Update - Post-update actions (cache refresh)
5. Before Delete - Authorization checks
6. After Delete - Cleanup operations (cache invalidation)

Pattern Used:
- Logger from @webiny/api/logger
- Result pattern for validation errors
- Redirect-specific validation logic
- URL format validation
- Status code validation (301, 302, 307, 308)
- Circular redirect detection
- Pattern matching validation

Redirect-Specific Validations:
- Source URL format
- Target URL validation
- Valid HTTP status codes
- Circular redirect prevention
- Wildcard pattern validation
- Duplicate redirect checks

Target Audience: Developers extending redirect behavior, implementing custom redirect rules, or building redirect management tools.

Note: Corrected folder path after initial error (/redirects/ not /redirect/).
