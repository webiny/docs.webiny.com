AI Context: Background Tasks - Management (tasks/management.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Analyzed the background tasks reference.mdx for available operations
2. Identified task management operations (get, list, update, delete)
3. Examined the ITasks interface and its methods
4. Understood the task lifecycle and status management

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Created a practical guide for managing tasks
- Documented each CRUD operation separately
- Showed how to retrieve task information
- Explained task status updates
- Demonstrated task deletion
- Used the ITasks interface from the context
- Included practical examples for each operation
- Added usage descriptions explaining when and why to use each operation

Operations Documented:
1. Get Task - Retrieve a single task by ID
2. List Tasks - Query multiple tasks
3. Update Task - Modify task properties (status, output, error)
4. Delete Task - Remove completed/failed tasks

Pattern Observed:
- All operations accessed through context.tasks
- Result pattern used consistently
- Task status management (pending, success, failed, aborted)
- Each operation returns Result<Task | Task[], Error>

Target Audience: Developers who need to programmatically manage background tasks, monitor their status, or implement custom task management logic.
