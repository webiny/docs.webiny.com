AI Context: Background Tasks - About (tasks/about.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Read tasks/reference.mdx to understand the implementation details
2. Analyzed the background tasks system architecture from reference examples
3. Examined the task runner, context, and controller patterns
4. Extracted high-level concepts from the technical reference

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Created an introductory/overview document explaining what background tasks are
- Focused on the "why" and "when" rather than "how" (that's in reference.mdx)
- Explained the core concepts:
  - Tasks run asynchronously outside HTTP request/response cycle
  - Event-driven architecture
  - Task definition, triggering, and execution
  - Runner, controller, context pattern
- Kept it simple and accessible for junior developers
- Explained common use cases (data processing, external API calls, batch operations)
- Linked to the reference document for implementation details

Document Structure:
- Overview: What are background tasks
- What You'll Learn
- Key concepts explanation
- When to use background tasks
- Architecture overview
- Link to reference documentation

Tone: Educational, explaining concepts that junior developers need to understand before diving into implementation.
