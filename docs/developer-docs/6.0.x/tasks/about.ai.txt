AI Context: Background Tasks - About (tasks/about.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Read tasks/reference.mdx to understand the implementation details
2. Analyzed the background tasks system architecture from reference examples
3. Examined the task runner, context, and controller patterns
4. Extracted high-level concepts from the technical reference

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Created an introductory/overview document explaining what background tasks are
- Focused on the "why" and "when" rather than "how" (that's in reference.mdx)
- Explained the core concepts:
  - Tasks run asynchronously outside HTTP request/response cycle
  - Event-driven architecture
  - Task definition, triggering, and execution
  - Runner, controller, context pattern
- Kept it simple and accessible for junior developers
- Explained common use cases (data processing, external API calls, batch operations)
- Linked to the reference document for implementation details

Document Structure:
- Overview: What are background tasks
- What You'll Learn
- Key concepts explanation
- When to use background tasks
- Architecture overview
- Link to reference documentation

Tone: Educational, explaining concepts that junior developers need to understand before diving into implementation.

Related Documents:

- tasks/management.mdx - Task CRUD operations

Key Concepts to Explain:
1. What are background tasks? (async operations outside HTTP cycle)
2. Why use them? (long-running operations, data processing)
3. When to use them? (batch jobs, external API calls, heavy processing)
4. Architecture: Runner → Context → Controller pattern

Document Structure:
- Overview: What are background tasks
- What You'll Learn
- Key concepts (async, event-driven, lifecycle)
- Common use cases (examples)
- Architecture overview (high-level)
- Link to reference for implementation

Use Cases to Mention:
- Data import/export
- Batch email sending
- Image processing
- Report generation
- External API integrations
- Cleanup jobs

Junior-Friendly Explanations:
- Explain "outside HTTP cycle" (doesn't block requests)
- Explain "event-driven" (triggered by events, not cron)
- Explain runner/context/controller roles simply
- Avoid deep technical details (save for reference.mdx)

Tone Guidelines:
- Conceptual, not implementation-focused
- Accessible for juniors
- Motivate the "why" before the "how"
- Link to reference.mdx for details
