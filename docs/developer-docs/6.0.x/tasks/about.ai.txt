AI Context: Background Tasks - About (tasks/about.mdx)

Source of Information:
1. Read tasks/reference.mdx to understand the implementation details
2. Analyzed the background tasks system architecture from reference examples
3. Examined the task runner, context, and controller patterns
4. Extracted high-level concepts from the technical reference

Understanding Background Tasks:
Background tasks are operations that run asynchronously, outside the normal HTTP request/response cycle. When a user makes a web request, they get an immediate response, but the heavy work happens in the background.

Why Use Background Tasks:
- Don't Block Users: Heavy operations don't slow down page loads
- Handle Long Operations: Data processing that takes minutes or hours
- Retry on Failure: If something fails, retry it automatically
- Scale Better: Process many tasks in parallel

When to Use Background Tasks:
- Data import/export (processing CSV files, etc.)
- Batch email sending
- Image/video processing
- Report generation
- External API integrations
- Cleanup jobs (delete old data)

Key Documentation Decisions:
- Created an introductory/overview document explaining what background tasks are
- Focused on the "why" and "when" rather than "how" (that's in reference.mdx)
- Explained the core concepts:
  - Tasks run asynchronously outside HTTP request/response cycle
  - Event-driven architecture
  - Task definition, triggering, and execution
  - Runner, controller, context pattern
- Kept it simple and accessible
- Explained common use cases (data processing, external API calls, batch operations)
- Linked to the reference document for implementation details

Document Structure:
- Overview: What are background tasks
- What You'll Learn
- Key concepts explanation
- When to use background tasks
- Architecture overview
- Link to reference documentation

Architecture Components:
- Runner: Finds tasks to process and executes them (iterate + run methods)
- Context: Provides access to task data and operations (read task properties, call task methods)
- Controller: Manages task status and output (success, error, abort methods)

Simple Flow:
1. Trigger a task (creates a task with name and input data)
2. Runner finds pending tasks (iterate method)
3. Runner processes each task (run method)
4. Controller updates task status (success/error/aborted)

Key Terms Explained:
- "Outside HTTP cycle" = Doesn't block web requests, runs independently
- "Event-driven" = Triggered by events (like "entry created"), not time-based schedules
- "Async" = Runs in the background while other things continue

Tone Guidelines:
- Conceptual, not implementation-focused
- Accessible explanations
- Motivate the "why" before the "how"
- Link to reference.mdx for implementation details
