## Overview

Once you've created background tasks, you need to manage them - trigger execution, monitor progress, view logs, and abort tasks when needed. Webiny provides two ways to manage tasks:

1. **GraphQL API** - Use GraphQL queries and mutations to manage tasks from your frontend applications or external tools
2. **Programmatic API** - Trigger tasks directly from your backend code using the `TaskService`

### What You Can Do

- **List available task definitions** - See all registered background tasks in your system
- **Trigger task execution** - Start a task with custom input parameters
- **Monitor task runs** - Check status, iterations, start/finish times, and results
- **View task logs** - Debug issues by reviewing detailed execution logs
- **Abort running tasks** - Stop tasks that are running too long or are no longer needed

The GraphQL API returns a consistent response structure with `data` and `error` fields, making error handling straightforward. All queries and mutations follow the Result pattern used throughout Webiny.

## Management of Tasks via GraphQL

### List Available Task Definitions

Use this query to see all registered background tasks in your system. Each definition includes the task ID, title, and description you defined when creating the task.

```graphql
query ListTaskDefinitions {
  backgroundTasks {
    listDefinitions {
      data {
        id
        title
        description
      }
      error {
        message
        code
        data
        stack
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### List All Task Runs

Use this query to see all task executions. Each task run includes its status, timestamps, iterations, input/output data, and more. This helps you monitor task progress and troubleshoot issues.

```graphql
query ListTasks {
  backgroundTasks {
    listTasks {
      data {
        id
        startedOn
        finishedOn
        name
        definitionId
        iterations
        parentId
        executionName
        eventResponse
        taskStatus
        input
        output
        # ...more fields available
      }
      error {
        message
        code
        data
        stack
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### List All Task Logs

Use this query to view detailed execution logs for debugging. You can filter logs by task ID to see what happened during a specific task execution. Logs include messages, timestamps, types, and error details.

```graphql
query ListBackgroundTaskLogs {
  backgroundTasks {
    listLogs(where: {
    # you can list logs from a certain task if you like
    task: "yourTaskId"
  }) {
      data {
        id
        createdOn
        executionName
        iteration
        items {
          message
          createdOn
          type
          data
          error
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Trigger a Task

  backgroundTasks {
    triggerTask(definition: testingRun, input: {
      someVariableForTestingRunTaskToReceive: "someValue",
      yetAnotherVariableForTestingRunTaskToReceive: "anotherValue"
    }) {
      data {
        id
        definitionId
        executionName
        eventResponse
        taskStatus
        input
        # ... more fields available
      }
      error {
        message
        code
        data
        stack
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Abort a Task

Use this mutation to stop a running task. Provide the task ID and optionally a message explaining why the task is being aborted. The task will stop at the next safe checkpoint.

```graphql
mutation AbortATask {
  backgroundTasks {
    # message is optional
    abortTask(id: "yourTaskId", message: "My Reason for aborting the task") {
      data {
        id
        createdOn
        savedOn
        startedOn
        finishedOn
        definitionId
        iterations
        name
        input
        output
        # ... more fields available
      }
      error {
        message
        code
        data
        stack
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Managing via Code

### Triggering a Task Programmatically

```typescript
import { TaskService } from "webiny/api/tasks";
const service = // resolved TaskService

const result = service.trigger({
    definition: "aTaskDefinitionId",
    delay: 0,
    parent: {
        id: "parentTaskId"
    },
    name: "My Task",
    input: {
        some: "data",
        for: "the task"
    }
});
```

### Aborting a Task Programmatically

```typescript
import { TaskService } from "webiny/api/tasks";
const service = // resolved TaskService

const result = service.abort({
    id: "taskIdToAbort",
    message: "Optional reason for aborting the task"
});
```
