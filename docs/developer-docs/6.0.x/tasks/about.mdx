## Overview

Tasks allow you to run long operations asynchronously without blocking your application. You can process batches, migrate data, or perform bulk operations in the background.

To create a background task, you implement the `TaskDefinition.Interface` and register it using `TaskDefinition.createImplementation()`.

## Available Methods

When creating a background task, you implement the following methods:

### Core Methods

- **`run()`** - The main method where your task logic executes. Required.
- **`createInputValidation()`** - Validates the input data before the task runs. Optional.

### Lifecycle Hooks

These hooks are called at different stages of task execution:

- **`onBeforeTrigger()`** - Called before the task is triggered.
- **`onDone()`** - Called when the task completes successfully.
- **`onError()`** - Called when the task fails with an error.
- **`onAbort()`** - Called when the task is manually aborted.
- **`onMaxIterations()`** - Called when the task reaches the maximum iteration limit.

## Task Responses

Inside the `run()` method, you receive a `controller` object that helps you control task execution. You use it to return different responses:

- **`controller.response.done()`** - Task completed successfully.
- **`controller.response.continue()`** - Task needs more time, will resume in the next iteration.
- **`controller.response.error()`** - Task encountered an error and should stop.
- **`controller.response.aborted()`** - Task was manually stopped.

## Controller Runtime Methods

The controller also provides runtime methods to check the task's execution state:

- **`controller.runtime.isAborted()`** - Returns `true` if the task was manually aborted.
- **`controller.runtime.isCloseToTimeout()`** - Returns `true` if the task is running out of time. Use this to return `continue()` and preserve your progress.
