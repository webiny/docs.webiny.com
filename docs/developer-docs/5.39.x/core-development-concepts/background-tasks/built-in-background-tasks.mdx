## Built-in Background Tasks

Webiny ships with a few of built-in Background Tasks. Some of them are used only internally (like clearing Cloudfront file cache), and some of them can be used publicly (Elasticsearch reindexing).

### Test Task

The test task is a task which is used for testing the Background Task mechanism.
Its definition is available [here](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/abb442c6d67c97980b8053c5e53db7fb4fec88b4/packages/tasks/src/tasks/testingRunTask.ts#L3).


### Elasticsearch Reindexing Task

<Alert type="info" title="Elasticsearch And OpenSearch Only!">
  This task will only get shipped with Elasticsearch and OpenSearch Webiny system.
</Alert>


The Elasticsearch/OpenSearch Reindexing is the first task we implemented via the Background Task mechanism.
Basically, it is a task which scans through the DynamoDB Elasticsearch table and pushes the data into the specific Elasticsearch/OpenSearch index.
Internally it is a bit more than that, but this is the basic idea. You can check the [definition](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/abb442c6d67c97980b8053c5e53db7fb4fec88b4/packages/api-elasticsearch-tasks/src/tasks/reindexing/reindexingTaskDefinition.ts#L12) and the [runner](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/abb442c6d67c97980b8053c5e53db7fb4fec88b4/packages/api-elasticsearch-tasks/src/tasks/reindexing/ReindexingTaskRunner.ts#L40) code for more information.

The task can be triggered either via code or via the GraphQL API.

#### Triggering the Task Via Code

Let's say that you have a Page Builder lifecycle event hook which triggers the task when the page is published, but only on index which contains the word `page` in its name.
```typescript
const myHook = () => {
    return new ContextPlugin(async(context) => {
        context.pageBuilder.onPageAfterPublish(async() => {
            await context.tasks.trigger({
                definition: "elasticsearchReindexing",
                input: {
                    matching: "page"
                }
            });
        })
    });
};
```

#### Triggering The Task Via GraphQL API

The task can be triggered via the GraphQL API, with the following mutation:
```graphql
mutation TriggerTask {
  backgroundTasks {
    triggerTask(definition: elasticsearchReindexing, input: {
      matching: "page"
    }) {
      data {
        id
      }
      error {
        message
        code
        data
        stack
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The task disables indexing on all matching indexes, and enables it when the task is finished.
This is done to reduce the strain on the Elasticsearch/OpenSearch cluster as the reindexing operation is a heavy one.
