## Overview

First, you need to know that there are two types of Background Tasks:
- public - can be called via GraphQL API or the programmatic API
- private - can be called only through the programmatic API

Definition of the task is the same for both types of tasks, with a difference of the method name used to define the task.


## Basic Definition

To see all available properties, and information about the properties, for the task definition, check the [`ITaskDefinition`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/abb442c6d67c97980b8053c5e53db7fb4fec88b4/packages/tasks/src/types.ts#L328) interface.

There are few properties, which should not be used:
 - `fields` - not implemented yet
 - `isPrivate` - set automatically when a user defines a task via `createPrivateTaskDefinition`

### Public Task
```typescript
import { createTaskDefinition } from "@webiny/tasks";

const myPublicTaskDefinition = createTaskDefinition({
    id: "myPublicTask",
    title: "A Task Accessible Via API",
    async run({response}) {
        // your code here
        return response.done();
    }
});
```

### Private Task
```typescript
import { createPrivateTaskDefinition } from "@webiny/tasks";

const myPrivateTaskDefinition = createPrivateTaskDefinition({
    id: "myPrivateTask",
    title: "A Task Accessible Only Via The Code",
    async run({response}) {
        // your code here
        return response.done();
    }
});
```

## Advanced Definition
 

```typescript
const syncArticles = createTaskDefinition({
    id: "syncArticles",
    title: "Sync Articles",
    description: "A task which syncs Webiny articles with another system.",
    // optional when defined via the createTaskDefinition or createPrivateTaskDefinition method
    // default value is 500
    maxIterations: 1000,
    async run({response}) {
        // your code which syncs articles with another system
        return response.done();
    },
    onBeforeTrigger: async({context, input}) => {
        // check if articles are already syncing
        // if yes, throw an error
    },
    onDone: async({context, task}) => {
        // notify another system that articles are synced
    },
    onError: async({context, task}) => {
        // notify another system that articles are not synced due to an error
    },
    onAbort: async({context, task}) => {
        // notify another system that articles are not synced due to user aborting the task
    },
    onMaxIterations: async({context, task}) => {
        // notify another system that articles are not synced due to reaching max iterations of the task
    },
});
```

## Registering the Task

Of course, as all other Webiny plugins, users must register the task definition in the `plugins` array of the `createHandler` function.
```typescript
export const handler = createHandler({
    plugins: [
        // ...rest of plugins
        syncArticles
    ]
});
```
