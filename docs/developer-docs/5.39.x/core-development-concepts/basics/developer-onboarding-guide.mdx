## Webiny Overview
Webiny is an open-source content management system designed for enterprises. It’s built on top of the serverless infrastructure to enable great scalability and site reliability even in the most demanding periods.

Webiny is not your traditional CMS, nor your typical headless CMS. Webiny includes a set of applications that cater to a broad set of cases. Applications that come with Webiny are:

- Headless CMS
- Page Builder
- Form Builder
- File Manager
- Advanced Publishing Workflow
- Webiny Control Panel (also referred to as WCP)
- Admin

<Alert type="info"> 

  Learn more about the full features of Webiny and its applications [here](/docs/{version}/overview/introduction).

</Alert>

## Serverless Architecture

Webiny is built on a serverless infrastructure to ensure excellent scalability and reliability, especially during peak traffic periods.
Serverless computing lets you build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. It eliminates the need to manage infrastructure for your applications. In the serverless world, your cloud service provider takes care of provisions, scales, and managing infrastructure required to run the code. 

<Alert type="info">

  If you are not familiar with serverless technology, please refer to this [Serverless Knowledge Base](https://www.webiny.com/knowledge-base/serverless). It provides answers to the most commonly asked questions about serverless computing and its benefits.

## Core Development Concepts
In this section we will look into some core development concepts that can help you in development with Webiny.

### Plugins

Plugins are the fundamental building blocks in Webiny; everything is composed of plugins. So, if you're wondering how to build or customize something within Webiny, the answer is typically to write a plugin for it. Whether you're adding a feature or making a customization, you'll find that nearly all enhancements in Webiny are achieved through plugins. Our documentation provides detailed guides on how to create plugins for various functionalities and customizations.

<Alert type="info">

  Learn about [plugins](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/plugins), how they work, and the differences between frontend and backend environments.

</Alert>


### Webiny CLI

Webiny CLI (command line interface) is the central tool that you’ll be using throughout the complete project development process, in your terminal of choice.

<Alert type="info">

  Learn what [Webiny CLI](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/webiny-cli) is and how it can help you in your project development.

</Alert>


### Project Applications

Webiny uses the term project application (or just application) in order to depict a specific logical segment of your project.
Project applications are higher-level organizational units formed from one or more packages that, as the name itself suggests, form applications. Every application, essentially, consists of two pieces:
- Your application code, which includes one or more Node.js packages.
- Cloud infrastructure that hosts your code or which is being utilized by it, which is also described and deployed using code.

<Alert type="info">

 Learn what are [Project Applications](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/project-organization/project-applications) and how they're structured.

</Alert>


### Monorepo Organization

Every Webiny project is organized as a monorepoexternal link. This essentially means your project is organized as a collection of multiple NPM packages, or, in the context of monorepos, multiple workspaces.

<Alert type="info">

  Learn what are [monorepo](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/project-organization/monorepo-organization) and what are the benefits this project organization brings.

</Alert>

### Tools & Libraries

<Alert type="info">

  Learn about different [tools and libraries](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/tools-and-libraries) that are included in every Webiny project.

</Alert>


### Project Deployment
Webiny makes it easy to deploy your project, using the Webiny CLI and Pulumi as the default infrastructure as code and deployment solution. You can also easily deploy your project into multiple environments.

<Alert type="info">

  Learn how to [deploy your Webiny project](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/project-deployment) and its project applications, using the Webiny CLI.

</Alert>


### Local Development

Serverless development has slightly different principles from traditional application development. In the traditional development process, developers typically develop and test their project locally before deploying it to a server. However, in the serverless world, this process is slightly different.

<Alert type="info">

  Learn about how to do [local development in Webiny](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/development/local-development).

</Alert>

## Infrastructure

Project deployment is an important part of an application development lifecycle. Essentially, deploying your project entails the deployment of necessary cloud infrastructure resources with the application code you wrote. It can be done from your machine directly, which is usually the case when developing, or from a remote environment, for example CI/CD systems, that, based on provided instructions, deploy your project automatically for you.

<Alert type="info">

  Learn what are [deployments and how they work with Webiny](/docs/{version}/infrastructure/basics/introduction).

</Alert>


### Architecture

A Webiny project consists of four [project applications](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/project-organization/project-applications):

1. **Core** (`./apps/core`) - defines core cloud infrastructure resources
1. **API** (`./apps/api`) - your project's (GraphQL) HTTP API
1. **Admin** (`./apps/admin`) - your admin area
1. **Website** (`./apps/website`) - your public website

If we wanted to compare these applications by the complexity of the cloud infrastructure, we could say that **Core** and **API** are the most complex ones. This is simply because these deploy more different cloud infrastructure resources than the remaining **Admin** and **Website** project applications.

<Alert type="info">

Visit the [Architecture](/docs/{version}/architecture/introduction) documentation that explains everything related to the cloud infrastructure Webiny relies on. 

</Alert>

### Environments

Your project can be deployed into multiple environments. This means that you can have multiple “copies” of your project up and running at the same time, each having its own name and purpose.

<Alert type="info">

  Learn [what are environments](/docs/{version}/infrastructure/basics/environments) and how they work in a Webiny project.

</Alert>


### Preview Deployments

During the project development, there is a chance that the deployed cloud infrastructure needs to change. New resources might be added, existing resources configured differently, and some may even need to be destroyed.

When doing more significant changes, it might be helpful to preview the deployment process that you’re about to execute. More specifically, you would certainly like to know if the deployment you’re about to execute destroys a mission-critical resource, e.g. a database or a file storage resource.

<Alert type="info">

Learn how to [preview cloud infrastructure deployments](/docs/{version}/infrastructure/basics/preview-deployments), before actually executing them.

</Alert>


###  Deployment Modes

The Core and API project application can be deployed in two different deployment modes: development and production.


<Alert type="info">

Learn about development and production [deployment modes](/docs/{version}/architecture/deployment-modes/introduction).

</Alert>


### Destroy Cloud Infrastructure

<Alert type="info">

Learn how to [destroy the cloud infrastructure](/docs/{version}/infrastructure/basics/destroy-cloud-infrastructure) deployed for your project applications, using the Webiny CLI.

### Infrastructure Best Practices

<Alert type="info">

Learn what are some of the core best practices when it comes to [managing the infrastructure](/docs/{version}/infrastructure/basics/best-practices) for your Webiny instances.

</Alert>

### CI/CD

The process of application development is much more than just writing application code. It entails several different subprocesses, which are equally, if not more, important. For example:

- testing
- deployment into multiple environments
- organizing code in multiple Version Control System (VCS) branches
- choosing the right cloud infrastructure resources for the job
- storing and managing cloud infrastructure state files
- security
- monitoring and observability
- team organization

In the our documentation, we cover some of these subprocesses and provide best practices around how to structure and implement them, within your CI/CD workflow.

<Alert type="info">

  Learn about [CI/CD](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/ci-cd/introduction) in general and [how to set up a CI/CD pipeline for your Webiny project](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/ci-cd/setup).

#### Theming Introduction

When you’re creating forms in the Form Builder, you have the option to preview forms right there inside the same interface.
How the form looks visually is controlled via the form layout that is selected for that form. 
The default theme includes a single form layout which should fit most use-cases. If you wish to do any visual tweaks, it’s best to just modify the stylesheets.

For more advance case you might want to create a custom form layout. The best approach would be to copy the existing one and update the things you need to adapt.

## Release Management

### Branching Strategy
At Webiny, we like to release versions relatively often (in 2-3 weeks cycles), so our users get all the new features and bug fixes that we add to the product. We have a quarterly major release cycle during which we launch significant new features.

However, since Webiny is not a simple library, upgrading between project versions can be cumbersome, and not all users want to do it that often. Sometimes, upgrades require code mods to modify your project files, database migrations get executed, so it’s a bit more complex than just pulling in a new NPM package version.

<Alert type="info">

 Learn how Webiny team organizes GitHub branches and what are our [release cycles](/docs/{version}/release-management/branching-strategy).

</Alert>

### Release Notes
We maintain a dedicated section for Release Notes, Upgrade Guides, and Change Logs to help you stay updated and efficiently manage upgrades.

<Alert type="info">

  Visit the [Release Notes](/docs/{version}/release-notes/upgrade-webiny) section for detailed information on upgrade guides and the release changelog.
