## About

In the 5.31.0 version of Webiny we have refactored our handler package (`@webiny/handler`) to use [fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify).
Fastify has a quite extensive [documentation](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/), so feel free to check it out if you need to modify our default behavior.

Fastify enables us to:

- add the possibility to add new [routes](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Routes/) and event handling
- consistent [`request`](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Request/) and [`reply`](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Reply/) (formerly response in our system) methods throughout the system
- a lot of request [lifecycle events](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Lifecycle/) for users to hook into
- implement some other cloud service, at some point, more easily

The `@webiny/handler` package does not differentiate between incoming Lambda requests, that is left to the `@webiny/handler-aws` package, which has a possibility to handle few types of events:

- API Gateway Event
- EventBridge Event
- SQS Event
- SNS Event
- S3 Event
- DynamoDB Stream Event
- Raw Event - this one is different from the others, we will go into details in a separate section

### The Main `createHandler` Method

This method is a simple one, as its only job is to choose the specific event handler to be used based on the event it receives.

There is only one `createHandler` to be used and it can be imported from `@webiny/handler-aws`.

```typescript
import { createHandler } from "@webiny/handler-aws";

const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    // ... plugins
  ],
  debug: process.env.DEBUG === "true"
});
```

This `createHandler` method will handle all incoming events, except the Raw event, which is handled by the `createRawHandler` method, imported from the `@webiny/handler-aws` or `createHandler` imported from `@webiny/handler-aws/raw`.

### Event Specific Handlers

The underlying event handlers, which the main `createHandler` chooses depending on the event type, actually initialize the Webiny system.
They will initialize [`fastify`](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/), context and everything which is defined by plugins that were passed on.

There are multiple event handlers shipped with our system, but if we missed something that you need - and is an AWS event type, feel free to open an issue or a PR.

#### API Gateway Route (Event)

This handler uses [@fastify/aws-lambda](https://github.com/fastify/aws-lambda-fastify) in the background to handle API Gateway events. It transforms [APIGatewayEvent](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/aws-lambda/trigger/api-gateway-proxy.d.ts#L60) into the request which `fastify` understands, and it is then used throughout the system.

For this handler to work it requires at least one [RoutePlugin](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/754c402e5df49ffb4cd07f8c53574ebe5e125f04/packages/handler/src/plugins/RoutePlugin.ts) to be initialized. It always returns [LambdaResponse](https://github.com/fastify/aws-lambda-fastify/blob/master/index.d.ts#L13) defined in the `@fastify/aws-lambda` package.

```typescript
import { createHandler, createApiGatewayRoute } from "@webiny/handler-aws";

const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    createApiGatewayRoute(({ onPost }) => {
      onPost("/my-url", async (request, reply) => {
        return iWillHandleThisRequest(request, reply);
      });
    })
  ]
});
```

Just note that the `Route` is actually an event, we just call it a route because it is a API Gateway route.

#### Raw Handler, Event Handler and Event

This handler uses a nice `fastify` feature that allows you to run any route you have previously defined. So basically, on initialization of the handler we add some dummy route (something like `webiny-raw-event`) and then run it via the `.inject()` method on `fastify` instance.
This is the same procedure being used in the `@fastify/aws-lambda` package.
The difference is that our Raw handler can return either [APIGatewayProxyResult](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/aws-lambda/trigger/api-gateway-proxy.d.ts#L135) or anything else that is directly sent from the [EventPlugin](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/754c402e5df49ffb4cd07f8c53574ebe5e125f04/packages/handler/src/plugins/EventPlugin.ts).

```ts
import { createRawHandler, createRawEventHandler } from "@webiny/handler-aws";

interface MyEventType {
  id: string;
  data: Record<string, any>;
}

const handler = createRawHandler({
  plugins: [
    createRawEventHandler<MyEventType>(async ({ event, context }) => {
      const result = await transformRawEventIntoSomethingUseable(event);

      await pushToSQS(event);
    })
  ]
});
```

#### S3 Event

```ts
import { createHandler, createS3EventHandler } from "@webiny/handler-aws";

const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    createS3EventHandler(async ({ event, context }) => {
      await deleteFileFromDynamoDb({ context, event });
    })
  ]
});
```

#### EventBridge Event

```ts
import { createHandler, createEventBridgeEventHandler } from "@webiny/handler-aws";

const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    createEventBridgeEventHandler(async ({ event, context }) => {
      const result = doSomethingWithEventBridgeEvent({ context, event });

      await storeResultIntoDynamoDB(result);
    })
  ]
});
```

#### SQS Event

```ts
import { createHandler, createSQSEventHandler } from "@webiny/handler-aws";

const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    createSQSEventHandler(async ({ event, context }) => {
      const result = doSomethingWithSQSEvent({ context, event });

      await triggerAnotherLambda(result);
    })
  ]
});
```

#### SNS Event

```ts
import { createHandler, createSNSEventHandler } from "@webiny/handler-aws";

const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    createSNSEventHandler(async ({ event, context }) => {
      const result = doSomeMagic({ context, event });

      await doSomeMoreMagic(result);
    })
  ]
});
```

#### DynamoDB Event

```ts
import { createHandler, createDynamoDBEventHandler } from "@webiny/handler-aws";

const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    createDynamoDBEventHandler(async ({ event, context }) => {
      const result = doSomethingWithDynamoDBEvent({ context, event });

      await transferResultToAnotherService(result);
    })
  ]
});
```

<Alert type="info">
  You can define as much routes and events as you like in a single `createHandler` method.
</Alert>

## Adding New Routes

Adding new routes is quite simple, but you need to add them via both Pulumi code and the RoutePlugin.

The Pulumi code goes into `apps/api/webiny.application.ts`. You must add the new route there, check out the example below, where we are adding a `[POST]/webiny` route.

```ts
import { createApiApp } from "@webiny/serverless-cms-aws";
import { ApiGraphql } from "@webiny/pulumi-aws";

export default createApiApp({
  pulumi: app => {
    const graphQLModule = app.getModule(ApiGraphql);

    graphQLModule.addRoute({
      // name must be in kebab-case
      name: "webiny",
      // path must start with /
      path: "/webiny",
      // all http methods allowed + ANY to catch all requests
      method: "POST"
    });
  }
});
```

Next thing you need to do is to add it into the `apps/api/graphql/src/index.ts` file via the `RoutePlugin` or `createApiGatewayRoute` method:

```ts apps/api/graphql/src/index.ts
// ... other imports
import { createHandler, createApiGatewayRoute } from "@webiny/handler-aws";

export const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    // ... other plugins
    createApiGatewayRoute(({ onPost }) => {
      onPost("/webiny", async (request, reply) => {
        // we can log the whole request body
        console.log(request.body);

        // and we can send some reply
        return reply
          .headers({
            "x-route-example": "yes"
          })
          .send({
            everything: {
              ok: true
            }
          });
      });
    })
  ],
  http: { debug }
});
```

<Alert type="warning">
  Security checks will be done as on the <strong>/graphql</strong> endpoint. If you need
  customizations, feel free to add them.
</Alert>

<Alert type="danger">Routes can be added only when initializing the handler.</Alert>

## Adding Event Handler

Adding event handlers is even simpler than adding routes. You just need to add the event handler for the Event type you need and that is it - no need for Pulumi code.

### Example

Let's say you created a part of code which sends out an SQS message, and you want to have a Lambda which handles that message.

Good example would be if you want to run some calculation, asynchronously, from our GraphQL Lambda.
You would insert an SQS Message and in turn it would trigger a Lambda which you have defined. That lambda should have code similar to this:

```ts
import { createHandler, createSQSEventHandler } from "@webiny/handler-aws";

const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    // other plugins
    createSQSEventHandler(async ({ request, reply, event, context, lambdaContext }) => {
      // the "context" variable is the same as in our system - as long as you haven't changed Webiny's default plugin loader
      // because it is an sqs event, you know the type of the "event" variable and you can handle it from there
      const result = await someHeavyCalculation(event);

      // maybe store that result into the database?
      await storeResult(result);

      return reply.send({
        ok: true
      });
    })
  ]
});
```

#### Multiple Event Handlers in a Single Handler

```ts
import {
  createHandler,
  createSQSEventHandler,
  createDynamoDBEventHandler
} from "@webiny/handler-aws";

const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    // This event handler will only be triggered when an SQS event is received.
    createSQSEventHandler(async ({ request, reply, event, context, lambdaContext }) => {
      // the "context" variable is the same as in our system - as long as you haven't changed Webiny's default plugin loader
      // because it is a sqs event, you know the type of the "event" variable, and you can handle it from there
      const result = await someHeavyCalculationOnSQSEvent(event);

      // maybe store that result into the database?
      await storeResult(result);

      return reply.send({
        ok: true
      });
    }),
    // This event handler will only be triggered when a DynamoDB event is received.
    createDynamoDBEventHandler(async ({ request, reply, event, context, lambdaContext }) => {
      const result = await heavyCalculationOnlyOnDynamoDBStreamEvent(event);

      return reply.send({
        result
      });
    })
  ]
});
```

#### Multiple Event Handlers of a Same Type in a Single Handler

You can define multiple event handlers, for example DynamoDB event handlers, in a single handler.

They will be executed in reverse order, meaning that the last one defined will be executed first.

There are few things to note:

- You should call `await next();` in your event handler, otherwise the next event handler will not be executed.
- You can return anything you want to from your event handler, just note that the next event handler will receive that value as a result if the `await next();` call.

```ts
import { createHandler, createDynamoDBEventHandler } from "@webiny/handler-aws";

const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    // This event handler will be triggered second.
    createDynamoDBEventHandler(async ({ request, reply, event, context, lambdaContext }) => {
      const result = await heavyCalculation(event);

      return {
        result
      };
    }),
    // This event handler will be triggered first.
    createDynamoDBEventHandler(async ({ request, reply, event, context, lambdaContext, next }) => {
      // this is how we trigger the second event handler (the one defined above)
      const resultFromPreviousEventHandler = await next();
      const result = await anotherHeavyCalculation(resultFromPreviousEventHandler, event);

      return reply.send({
        ...resultFromPreviousEventHandler,
        ...result
      });
    })
  ]
});
```

### Event Handler Response

When handling an event, you can either return the `reply` object or something else, what ever you like.
Basically, when you return the `reply`, a standard [APIGatewayProxyResult](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/aws-lambda/trigger/api-gateway-proxy.d.ts#L135) is created out of the data, headers and cookies you sent.
When you return anything else other than the `reply`, it is returned as the result of the handler, and the Lambda itself.

For example, you can send plain text or object to get the response of the Lambda without the need to parse the `APIGatewayProxyResult`.
