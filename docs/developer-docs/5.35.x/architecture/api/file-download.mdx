## Diagram

<Alert type="info">

For brevity, the diagram doesn't include network-level cloud infrastructure resources, like region, VPC, availability zones, and so on. Check out the [Deployment Modes](/docs/{version}/architecture/deployment-modes/introduction) section if you're interested in that aspect of the deployed cloud infrastructure.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

Note that the stateful resources like Amazon S3, Amazon Cognito, Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon ElasticSearch are deployed as part of the [Core](/docs/{version}/architecture/core/overview) project application. These are still included in the diagram, just so it's more clear to the reader.

## Description

The diagram shows what happens every time a client tries to download a binary file.

The flow consists of the following four steps:

1. The client issues a GET `/download/{file-key}` HTTP request, which reaches the Amazon API Gateway <diagram-letter>B</diagram-letter>, which then invokes the File Manager's Download AWS Lambda function <diagram-letter>G4</diagram-letter>.
2. The Download AWS Lambda function extracts the file key from the received HTTP request, and then fetches the file from the S3 bucket <diagram-letter>G1</diagram-letter>.
3. As a base64 encoded string, the file is returned to the Amazon API Gateway <diagram-letter>B</diagram-letter>, which transforms it to an actual binary, and sends it back to the Amazon CloudFront <diagram-letter>A</diagram-letter>.
4. Amazon CloudFront <diagram-letter>A</diagram-letter> receives the file, caches it, and sends it back to the client.
