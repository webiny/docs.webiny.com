- how to integrate Auth0 with a multi-tenant project

</WhatYouWillLearn>

## Overview

Auth0 integration replaces the default Cognito setup, and allows companies to manage users and their access to Webiny instances from within Auth0. Since Webiny's system of permissions contains rich permission objects, you can't define these in Auth0. Instead, assignment to security groups is happening using JSON Web Token (JWT) claims, which help you map every identity to a specific security group within Webiny, on a particular tenant.

## 1) Prepare the Project

Your project needs to be at version `5.34.0`, or greater, to use this feature.
Please follow the [upgrade guide](/docs/{version}/release-notes/upgrade-webiny) to upgrade your project to the appropriate version.

Alternatively, you can create a new `>=5.34.0` project, by running:

```shell
npx create-webiny-project my-project
```

<Alert type="info" title="MULTI-TENANCY">

If you need to use multi-tenancy, follow [this guide](/docs/{version}/enterprise/multi-tenancy) before continuing with the Auth0 setup.

</Alert>

<Alert type="warning" title="IMPORTANT">

If creating a new project, before following further instructions, make sure you complete the initial setup wizard with Cognito. This is a required step to successfully replace Cognito with Auth0.

</Alert>

## 2) Add New Dependencies

We need to add several new packages to the project.

Add Auth0 module dependency to the GraphQL API dependencies:

```shell
yarn workspace api-graphql add @webiny/api-security-auth0
```

Add Auth0 module dependency to the Admin app dependencies:

```shell
yarn workspace admin add @webiny/app-admin-auth0
```

## 3) Configure Auth0 in the GraphQL API

We need to update security configuration in a `graphql` Lambda  function.

The difference between your original file and the one below, is that we removed all Cognito plugins, and added Auth0 plugin instead, with some other tweaks to the security configuration. The most important changes are highlighted and commented for your convenience.

```diff-ts apps/api/graphql/src/security.ts
import { DocumentClient } from "aws-sdk/clients/dynamodb";
import { createTenancyContext, createTenancyGraphQL } from "@webiny/api-tenancy";
import { createStorageOperations as tenancyStorageOperations } from "@webiny/api-tenancy-so-ddb";
import { createSecurityContext, createSecurityGraphQL } from "@webiny/api-security";
import { createStorageOperations as securityStorageOperations } from "@webiny/api-security-so-ddb";
import { authenticateUsingHttpHeader } from "@webiny/api-security/plugins/authenticateUsingHttpHeader";
import apiKeyAuthentication from "@webiny/api-security/plugins/apiKeyAuthentication";
import apiKeyAuthorization from "@webiny/api-security/plugins/apiKeyAuthorization";
import anonymousAuthorization from "@webiny/api-security/plugins/anonymousAuthorization";
+ import { createAuth0 } from "@webiny/api-security-auth0";

export default ({ documentClient }: { documentClient: DocumentClient }) => [
    /**
     * Create Tenancy app in the `context`.
     */
    createTenancyContext({
        storageOperations: tenancyStorageOperations({ documentClient })
    }),

    /**
     * Expose tenancy GraphQL schema.
     */
    createTenancyGraphQL(),

    /**
     * Create Security app in the `context`.
     */
    createSecurityContext({
+       /**
+       * For Auth0, this must be set to `false`, as we don't have links in the database.
+       */
+       verifyIdentityToTenantLink: false,
        storageOperations: securityStorageOperations({ documentClient })
    }),

    /**
     * Expose security GraphQL schema.
     */
    createSecurityGraphQL({
+       /**
+        * For Auth0, we must provide custom logic to determine the "default" tenant for current identity.
+        * Since we're not linking identities to tenants via DB records, we can just return the current tenant.
+        */
+       async getDefaultTenant(context) {
+           return context.tenancy.getCurrentTenant();
+       }
    }),

    /**
     * Perform authentication using the common "Authorization" HTTP header.
     * This will fetch the value of the header, and execute the authentication process.
     */
    authenticateUsingHttpHeader(),

+   /**
+    * Configure Auth0 authentication and authorization.
+    */
+   createAuth0({
+       /**
+        * `domain` is required for token verification.
+        */
+       domain: String(process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN),
+       /**
+        * Construct the identity object and map token claims to arbitrary identity properties.
+        */
+       getIdentity({ token }) {
+           return {
+               id: token["sub"],
+               type: "admin",
+               displayName: token["name"],
+               // Assign any custom values you might need.
+               group: token["group"]
+           };
+       },
+       /**
+        * Get the slug of a security group to fetch permissions from.
+        */
+       getGroupSlug(context) {
+           const identity = context.security.getIdentity();
+
+           // Return group slug you want to map this identity to.
+           return identity["group"];
+       }
+   }),

    /**
     * API Key authenticator.
     * API Keys are a standalone entity, and are not connected to users in any way.
     * They identify a project, a 3rd party client, not a particular user.
     * They are used for programmatic API access, CMS data import/export, etc.
     */
    apiKeyAuthentication({ identityType: "api-key" }),

    /**
     * Authorization plugin to fetch permissions for a verified API key.
     * The "identityType" must match the authentication plugin used to load the identity.
     */
    apiKeyAuthorization({ identityType: "api-key" }),

    /**
     * Authorization plugin to load permissions for anonymous requests.
     * This allows you to control which API resources can be accessed publicly.
     * The authorization is performed by loading permissions from the "anonymous" user group.
     */
    anonymousAuthorization()
];
```

The last thing to do is to define Auth0 environment variables.

In your project directory, open the `.env` file, and define the following variables. To find the values of these variables, in your Auth0 dashboard, navigate to **Applications -> Applications**, and open the desired application. The values you need will be located under the **Basic Information** section.

```yml
# Auth0 variables for the API.
AUTH0_DOMAIN=https://dev-12345678.us.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=123456781234567812345678

# Auth0 variables for React apps (webpack will pick this up automatically, due to the REACT_APP_ prefix naming convention).
REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=https://dev-12345678.us.auth0.com
REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=123456781234567812345678
```

This will ensure that, when Pulumi starts the deploy process, these environment variables are present in `process.env`, and are assigned to your Lambda functions.

## 4) Configure Admin App

Open `apps/admin/src/App.tsx` and replace the Cognito plugin with Auth0 plugin:

```diff-tsx apps/admin/src/App.tsx
import React from "react";
import { Admin } from "@webiny/app-serverless-cms";
+ import { Auth0 } from "@webiny/app-admin-auth0";
import "./App.scss";

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <Admin>
+     <Auth0
+         auth0={{
+             domain: String(process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN),
+             clientId: String(process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID)
+         }}
+         rootAppClientId={String(process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID)}
+     />
    </Admin>
  );
};
```

With this, you're ready to deploy the project. To deploy the whole project, run the following:

```shell
yarn webiny deploy --env=dev
```

Or deploy just **API** and **Admin** project applications by running:

```shell
yarn webiny deploy api,admin --env=dev
```

## 5) Configuring App Client ID for New Tenants

Once your project is deployed, open your Admin app. If everything went well, you should be presented with an Auth0 login screen. The Auth0 user you're using to login must have access to the `root` tenant app client, and have the appropriate claims assigned to the user's JWT so the user can be mapped to the correct security group, as described in the [Configure Auth0 in the GraphQL API](/docs/{version}/enterprise/auth0-integration#3-configure-auth0-in-the-graphql-api) section.

<Alert type="success" title="Recommendation">

We recommend that your main root tenant admin user has a `full-access` group assignment. Think of this user as a **super admin** user who can run system setup, create new tenants, and so on. A `full-access` security group is always present in the system. So, you don't need to create it manually.

</Alert>

Once you've logged in, navigate to **Tenant Manager -> Tenants**. In the tenant creation form, there is a dedicated input for Auth0 App Client ID:

![Assign App Client ID to Tenant](./assets/auth0-integration/auth0-client-id.png)

The value entered here is what the Admin app will be fetching via the API during app bootstrap (on every browser reload). Since multiple tenants can use the same app client ID, for development purposes, you can have 1 Auth0 app shared between all the developers in the team, across all tenants in their development environments.

## 6) Accessing Admin App of a Particular Tenant

To point the browser to a specific tenant you want to access, you simply need to use the **tenantId** query string parameter:

```
http://localhost:3001/?tenantId=root
http://localhost:3001/?tenantId=61e6db7813ab8e0009e252d1
...
```
