## Diagram

<Alert type="info">

For brevity, the diagram doesn't include network-level cloud infrastructure resources, like region, VPC, availability zones, and so on. Check out the [Deployment Modes](/docs/{version}/architecture/deployment-modes/introduction) section if you're interested in that aspect of the deployed cloud infrastructure.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

Note that the stateful resources like Amazon S3, Amazon Cognito, Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon ElasticSearch are deployed as part of the [Core](/docs/{version}/architecture/core/overview) project application. These are still included in the diagram, just so it's more clear to the reader.

## Description

The diagram shows how HTTP requests (GraphQL queries and mutations) travel through the deployed cloud infrastructure. Request are primarily issued by the **Admin Area**, or **Website** applications, but of course, can be issued by other clients as well.

The flow consists of the following six steps:

1. The GraphQL HTTP request first reaches the Amazon CloudFront <diagram-letter>A</diagram-letter>.
2. The request is forwarded to the Amazon API Gateway <diagram-letter>B</diagram-letter>.
3. The Amazon API Gateway invokes the GraphQL Handler AWS Lambda function <diagram-letter>C</diagram-letter>.
4. Depending on the issued GraphQL operation, the AWS Lambda function's code may issue one or more requests to other cloud infrastructure resources:
   1. Amazon Cognito <diagram-letter>E</diagram-letter> to perform identity authentication
   2. Amazon DynamoDB <diagram-letter>F</diagram-letter> or Amazon ElasticSearch Service <diagram-letter>G</diagram-letter> to perform database queries
5. Once the code execution has completed, an HTTP response is returned back to the Amazon API Gateway <diagram-letter>B</diagram-letter>.
6. The Amazon API Gateway <diagram-letter>B</diagram-letter> forwards the request to the Amazon CloudFront <diagram-letter>A</diagram-letter>, which again forwards it back to the client.
