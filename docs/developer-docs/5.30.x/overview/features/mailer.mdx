## About

Starting from 5.30.0 version of Webiny we have a mailer package (`@webiny/api-mailer`) via which you can send e-mails.

## Available Mailers

We have a couple of built-in e-mail mailers:

- Dummy Mailer - does not send e-mails, just records them in an array which you can access later
- SMTP Mailer - sends e-mails with the help of [nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) library

### Dummy Mailer

A mailer which pretends to be sending e-mails. Used for testing and as a backup in case no other mailer is configured or defined.

You can manually set it as the mailer so e-mails never actually get sent:

```typescript
import { createDummyMailer } from "@webiny/api-mailer";

context.mailer.setMailer(async () => {
  return createDummyMailer();
});
```

### SMTP Mailer

A mailer which sends e-mails via the defined SMTP credentials. In the background it uses [nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) library to send the e-mails.

#### Basic Configuration

The configuration is done via the environment variables:

```bash
WEBINY_MAILER_HOST=smtp.localhost.test
WEBINY_MAILER_USER=root
WEBINY_MAILER_PASSWORD=password
```

If any of these variables is not defined, mailer will default to the Dummy Mailer.

#### Advanced Configuration

The advanced configuration is done by creating your own SMTP mailer with custom config. You can use our `createSmtpMailer` method, you just need to pass the custom configuration.

Here is an example on how to configure custom mailer:

```typescript
import { createSmtpMailer, SmtpMailerConfig } from "@webiny/api-mailer";
import { MailerContext } from "@webiny/api-mailer/types";

/**
 * First we configure the STMP mailer.
 */
const config: SmtpMailerConfig = {
  host: "smtp.localhost.test",
  auth: {
    user: "root",
    pass: "password"
  }
};
const mailer = createSmtpMailer(config);

/**
 * ... then you need to set the mailer to your application
 */

export const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    ...plugins,
    createMailer(),
    // after createMailer() method we can set new mailer
    new ContextPlugin<MailerContext>(async context => {
      context.mailer.setMailer(mailer);
    }),
    ...more_plugins
  ],
  http: { debug }
});
```

Note that `setMailer` method supports both setting the variable of `Mailer` type or an async `Mailer` factory.

Here is an example of a context plugin which sets mailer via factory:

```typescript
const plugin = new ContextPlugin<MailerContext>(async context => {
  context.mailer.setMailer(async () => {
    return import("./pathToSomeMailer").then(createMailer => {
      return createMailer();
    });
  });
});
```

## Usage

For example, let's say you want to send an e-mail when user creates an entry in the `Person` model.
You would want to subscribe to the `onAfterEntryCreate` event and send an e-mail only when added entry to that certain model.

```typescript
const plugin = new ContextPlugin<MailerContext>(async context => {
  context.cms.onAfterEntryCreate.subscribe(async ({ entry, model }) => {
    if (model.modelId !== "person") {
      return;
    }
    try {
      const response = await context.mailer.send({
        data: {
          to: ["me@test.local"],
          from: "webiny@test.local",
          subject: `A new entry in the ${model.name} model was created`,
          text: `A new entry in the ${model.name} was created. ID of the entry is ${entry.id}`,
          html: `<h2>A new entry in the ${model.name}</h2>
                  <p>Entry ID is ${entry.id}, url is ${createEntryUrl(entry)}</p>`
        }
      });
      if (response.result) {
        return;
      } else if (!response.error) {
        console.log("E-mail was not sent, but there is no error in the response.");
        return;
      }
      console.log(response.error);
    } catch (ex) {
      console.log(ex.message);
    }
  });
});
```
