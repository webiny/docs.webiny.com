## Introduction

Out of the box, Webiny's Page Builder app provides a plethora of ready-made page elements we can use to create both simple and complex pages for our website. Furthermore, on top of the default set, users can also create their custom page elements, which is what this article demonstrates.

In this short article, we create a relatively simple page element that allows users to show a list of different [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) rocket and dragon spacecrafts. Here's what the final result will look like:

![SpaceX Page Element](./assets/create-a-page-element/preview.png)

The custom page element will be available from the **Media** page elements category:

<Image
  title="SpaceX Page Element in the Elements Menu (Media category)"
  src={elementInSidebar}
  style={{ width: 450 }}
/>

Also, upon dropping the element onto a page, users will have the ability to adjust the following three settings:

1. type of spacecrafts to be displayed (rockets or dragons)
2. number of spacecrafts to be displayed
3. pagination offset (number of spacecrafts we want to skip when retrieving the data)

<Image
  title="SpaceX Page Element in the Elements Menu (Media category)"
  src={elementSettings}
  style={{ width: 450 }}
/>

Note that the spacecrafts data will be retrieved from a non-official public SpaceX GraphQL HTTP API, located at https://spacex-production.up.railway.app/. Meaning, changing these settings will dictate the variables that will be included in GraphQL queries issued by the page element. More on this in the following sections.

## Getting Started

### Renderer React Component

To create a custom page element, we first need to create a [renderer React component](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.34.0/packages/app-page-builder-elements/src/types.ts#L129-L131) which, as the name itself suggests, renders it. As we'll be able to see, this is easily achieved via the [`createRenderer`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.34.0/packages/app-page-builder-elements/src/createRenderer.tsx) factory function.

### Plugins

Via a couple of plugins, the next step is registering the renderer React component within our project's **Admin** and **Website** apps.

<Alert type={"info"}>

In case you missed it, the **Admin** and **Website** apps are located in the `apps/admin` and `apps/website` folders of an existing Webiny project.

</Alert>

On the **Admin** app side, we first register the [`PbEditorPageElementPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.34.0/packages/app-page-builder/src/types.ts#L498-L536) plugin, which enables us to introduce our custom page element into the Page Builder's page editor and enables users to drop the new element onto a page.

After that, optionally, we register the [`PbEditorPageElementAdvancedSettingsPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.34.0/packages/app-page-builder/src/types.ts#L642-L647) plugin, which lets us define all the related settings that are available to users upon dropping the page element onto a page. Since the page element we're building does contain settings that the user can adjust, we will need this plugin as well.

When it comes to the **Website** app, here we register the [`PbRenderElementPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.34.0/packages/app-page-builder/src/types.ts#L375-L380) plugin. With it, we ensure our renderer React component is utilized upon serving a published page to an actual website visitor. Note we'll also need this plugin on the **Admin** app side because previewing pages is possible there too, outside the page editor.

![Page Preview In the Admin App](./assets/create-a-page-element/admin-page-preview.png)

### Code Organization

There are multiple approaches when it comes to where to place our custom page element code. In this tutorial, we will be placing all the code in the [`apps/theme`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/page-builder/spacex-page-element/apps/theme) folder. More specifically, we'll create a new [`apps/theme/pageElements`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/page-builder/spacex-page-element/apps/theme/pageElements) folder, and inside it, the new [`apps/theme/pageElements/spaceX`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/page-builder/spacex-page-element/apps/theme/pageElements/spaceX) folder.

<Alert type={"info"}>

The
[`apps/theme/pageElements`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/page-builder/spacex-page-element/apps/theme/pageElements)
folder can be further used as a folder for all of your custom page elements.

</Alert>

### Overview of Files

Ultimately, in the [`apps/theme/pageElements/spaceX`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/page-builder/spacex-page-element/apps/theme/pageElements/spaceX) folder, we'll end up with the following three files:

1. [`SpaceX.tsx`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/page-builder/spacex-page-element/apps/theme/pageElements/spaceX/SpaceX.tsx) - contains the renderer React component
2. [`admin.tsx`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/page-builder/spacex-page-element/apps/theme/pageElements/spaceX/admin.tsx) - contains the **Admin** app plugins
3. [`website.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/page-builder/spacex-page-element/apps/theme/pageElements/spaceX/website.ts) - contains the **Website** app plugin

### Useful Webiny CLI Commands

For easier development, both **Admin** and **Website** apps can be run and developed locally. This is done via the following two [`webiny watch`](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/watch-command) commands:

```bash
yarn webiny watch admin --env YOUR_ENV
```

```bash
yarn webiny watch website --env YOUR_ENV
```

If needed, both commands can be run at the same time, via two separate terminal sessions.

## Implementation

### Renderer React Component

As previously mentioned, in order to create a custom page element, we start off by creating a new renderer React component. We create the [`apps/theme/pageElements/spaceX/SpaceX.tsx`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/page-builder/spacex-page-element/apps/theme/pageElements/spaceX/SpaceX.tsx) file with the following code:

```tsx apps/theme/pageElements/spaceX/SpaceX.tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { request } from "graphql-request";
import { createRenderer, useRenderer } from "@webiny/app-page-builder-elements";

// For simplicity, we're hard-coding the GraphQL HTTP API URL here.
const GQL_API_URL = "https://spacex-production.up.railway.app/";

// These are the necessary GraphQL queries we'll need in order to retrieve data.
const QUERIES = {
  rockets: /* GraphQL */ `
    query listRockets($limit: Int, $offset: Int) {
      data: rockets(limit: $limit, offset: $offset) {
        id
        name
        description
        wikipedia
      }
    }
  `,
  dragons: /* GraphQL */ `
    query listDragons($limit: Int, $offset: Int) {
      data: dragons(limit: $limit, offset: $offset) {
        id
        name
        description
        wikipedia
      }
    }
  `
};

export interface Spacecraft {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  wikipedia: string;
}

// It's often useful to type the data that the page element will carry.
export interface SpaceXElementData {
  variables: {
    limit: string;
    offset: string;
    type: "rockets" | "dragons";
  };
}

// The renderer React component.
export const SpaceX = createRenderer(() => {
  // Let's retrieve the variables that were chosen by
  // the user upon dropping the page element onto the page.
  const { getElement } = useRenderer();
  const element = getElement<SpaceXElementData>();
  const { limit, offset, type } = element.data.variables;

  const [data, setData] = useState<Spacecraft[]>([]);

  // This is where we fetch the data and store it into component's state.
  useEffect(() => {
    request(GQL_API_URL, QUERIES[type], {
      limit: parseInt(limit),
      offset: parseInt(offset)
    }).then(({ data }) => setData(data));
  }, [limit, offset, type]);

  if (!data.length) {
    return <>Nothing to show.</>;
  }

  // If the data has been retrieved, we render it via a simple unordered list.
  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map(item => (
        <li key={item.id}>
          <h1>{item.name}</h1>
          <div>{item.description}</div>
          <br />
          <div>
            More info at&nbsp;
            <a href={item.wikipedia} target={"_blank"} rel={"noreferrer"}>
              {item.wikipedia}
            </a>
          </div>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
});
```

Note that, for simplicity's sake, all the code is placed in a single file. Of course, it is possible to organize it across multiple files, if preferred.

Furthermore, in order to be able to issue remote GraphQL queries, we introduce the [`graphql-request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-request) package. The package can be installed via the following command, run from your project root:

```bash
yarn workspace theme add graphql-request
```

With this code in place, we're ready for the next step, which is registering the renderer React component within our **Admin** and **Website** apps. We'll start with the **Website** app, as the plugin that we'll create here will also be needed within the **Admin** app.

### Website App

As previously mentioned, ensuring our custom renderer React component is actually used upon rendering a published page is done via the [`PbRenderElementPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.34.0/packages/app-page-builder/src/types.ts#L375-L380) plugin. For this, we'll create a new [`apps/theme/pageElements/spaceX/website.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/page-builder/spacex-page-element/apps/theme/pageElements/spaceX/website.ts) file with the following code:

```ts
import { PbRenderElementPlugin } from "@webiny/app-page-builder/types";
import { SpaceX } from "./SpaceX";

const plugin = {
  name: "pb-render-page-element-space-x",
  type: "pb-render-page-element",
  elementType: "spaceX",
  render: SpaceX
} as PbRenderElementPlugin;

export default plugin;
```

With this plugin in place, we need to register it within the **Website** app. This can be achieved via the [`apps/website/src/plugins/pageBuilder.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/page-builder/spacex-page-element/apps/website/src/plugins/pageBuilder.ts#L88) file:

```diff-ts apps/website/src/plugins/pageBuilder.ts
// The rest of code was removed for brevity.
+ import spaceX from "theme/pageElements/spaceX/website";

// ...

export default [
    // ...
+   spaceX
    // ...
];
```

With the plugin registered, we're ready to move on to the next step, and that is the **Admin** app.

### Admin App

As previously mentioned, within the **Admin** app, we need two plugins: [`PbEditorPageElementPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.34.0/packages/app-page-builder/src/types.ts#L498-L536) and [`PbEditorPageElementAdvancedSettingsPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.34.0/packages/app-page-builder/src/types.ts#L642-L647).

For simplicity's sake, we'll again place all the code in a single file, this time in [`apps/theme/pageElements/spaceX/admin.tsx`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/page-builder/spacex-page-element/apps/theme/pageElements/spaceX/admin.tsx):

```tsx apps/theme/pageElements/spaceX/admin.tsx
import React from "react";
import { validation } from "@webiny/validation";
import { Input } from "@webiny/ui/Input";
import { ButtonPrimary } from "@webiny/ui/Button";
import { Cell, Grid } from "@webiny/ui/Grid";
import { Select } from "@webiny/ui/Select";
import {
  PbEditorPageElementAdvancedSettingsPlugin,
  PbEditorPageElementPlugin
} from "@webiny/app-page-builder/types";

import { SpaceX, SpaceXElementData } from "./SpaceX";

const INITIAL_ELEMENT_DATA: SpaceXElementData = {
  variables: { type: "rockets", limit: "10", offset: "0" }
};

export default [
  // The `PbEditorPageElementPlugin` plugin.
  {
    name: "pb-editor-page-element-space-x",
    type: "pb-editor-page-element",
    elementType: "spaceX",
    render: SpaceX,
    toolbar: {
      // We use `pb-editor-element-group-media` to put our new
      // page element into the Media group in the left sidebar.
      title: "SpaceX",
      group: "pb-editor-element-group-media",
      preview() {
        // We can return any JSX / React code here. To keep it
        // simple, we are simply returning the element's name.
        return <>Space X Page Element</>;
      }
    },

    // Defines which types of element settings are available to the user.
    settings: [
      "pb-editor-page-element-settings-delete",
      "pb-editor-page-element-settings-visibility",
      "pb-editor-page-element-style-settings-padding",
      "pb-editor-page-element-style-settings-margin",
      "pb-editor-page-element-style-settings-width",
      "pb-editor-page-element-style-settings-height",
      "pb-editor-page-element-style-settings-background"
    ],

    // Defines onto which existing elements our element can be dropped.
    // In most cases, using `["cell", "block"]` will suffice.
    target: ["cell", "block"],
    onCreate: "open-settings",

    // `create` function creates the initial data for the page element.
    create(options) {
      return {
        type: "spaceX",
        elements: [],
        data: INITIAL_ELEMENT_DATA,
        ...options
      };
    }
  } as PbEditorPageElementPlugin,

  // The `PbEditorPageElementAdvancedSettingsPlugin` plugin.
  {
    name: "pb-editor-page-element-advanced-settings-space-x",
    type: "pb-editor-page-element-advanced-settings",
    elementType: "spaceX",
    render({ Bind, submit }) {
      // In order to construct the settings form, we're using the
      // `@webiny/form`, `@webiny/ui`, and `@webiny/validation` packages.
      return (
        <>
          <Grid>
            <Cell span={12}>
              <Bind name={"variables.type"}>
                <Select label={"Type"} description={"Chose the record type you want to query."}>
                  <option value="rockets">Rockets</option>
                  <option value="dragons">Dragons</option>
                </Select>
              </Bind>
            </Cell>
            <Cell span={12}>
              <Bind
                name={"variables.limit"}
                validators={validation.create("required,gte:0,lte:1000")}
              >
                <Input
                  label={"Limit"}
                  type="number"
                  description={"Number of records to be returned."}
                />
              </Bind>
            </Cell>
            <Cell span={12}>
              <Bind
                name={"variables.offset"}
                validators={validation.create("required,gte:0,lte:1000")}
              >
                <Input
                  label={"Offset"}
                  type="number"
                  description={"Amount of records to be skipped."}
                />
              </Bind>
            </Cell>
            <Cell span={12}>
              <ButtonPrimary onClick={submit}>Save</ButtonPrimary>
            </Cell>
          </Grid>
        </>
      );
    }
  } as PbEditorPageElementAdvancedSettingsPlugin
];
```

Before we register these plugins, note that, in order to construct the settings form, we're using the [`@webiny/form`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.34.0/packages/form), [`@webiny/ui`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.34.0/packages/ui), and [`@webiny/validation`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.34.0/packages/validation) packages. Since the [`@webiny/ui`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.34.0/packages/ui) is not installed within the [`apps/theme`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/page-builder/spacex-page-element/apps/theme) package by default, we need to install it. This can be done via the following command, run from your project root:

```bash
yarn workspace theme add @webiny/ui
```

When it comes to plugin registration, in total, there are three plugins we need to register within the **Admin** app. The two shown above, plus the previously created [`PbRenderElementPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.34.0/packages/app-page-builder/src/types.ts#L375-L380) plugin. The [`PbRenderElementPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.34.0/packages/app-page-builder/src/types.ts#L375-L380) is required because, as mentioned, pages can also be previewed within the **Admin** app, outside the page editor.

![Page Preview In the Admin App](./assets/create-a-page-element/admin-page-preview.png)

We register the two plugins via the [`apps/admin/src/plugins/pageBuilder/editorPlugins.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/page-builder/spacex-page-element/apps/admin/src/plugins/pageBuilder/editorPlugins.ts#L88) file:

```diff-ts apps/admin/src/plugins/pageBuilder/editorPlugins.ts
// Some of the code was removed for brevity.
+ import spaceX from "theme/pageElements/spaceX/admin";

// ...

export default [
    // ...
+   spaceX
    // ...
];
```

The [`PbRenderElementPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.34.0/packages/app-page-builder/src/types.ts#L375-L380) plugin can be registered via the [`apps/admin/src/plugins/pageBuilder/renderPlugins.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/page-builder/spacex-page-element/apps/admin/src/plugins/pageBuilder/renderPlugins.ts#L64) file:

```diff-ts apps/admin/src/plugins/pageBuilder/renderPlugins.ts
// The rest of code was removed for brevity.
+ import spaceX from "theme/pageElements/spaceX/website";

// ...

export default [
    // ...
+   spaceX
    // ...
];
```

With all the plugins registered, we're now ready to give this a try locally in our browser.

## Testing

With the above steps correctly completed, we should be able to see our custom page element in Page Builder's page editor and be able to drop it onto a page. The page element should also be correctly rendered when previewing the page, and also on the public website, once the page has been published.

<Video src={elementInEditor} controls={true} />

## Conclusion

Creating custom page elements is certainly an interesting option when users need more than what the default set of page elements provides.

On the code level, this could be creating completely custom (renderer) React components, including needed external NPM libraries, or even issuing remote HTTP requests to external HTTP APIs in order to retrieve data from standalone external systems.

On the other hand, custom page elements also add additional flexibility by allowing content creators to tweak elements' settings and, ultimately, help them achieve more with just a single page element.

## Tips and Tricks

### Control the style of the element wrapper

In certain cases, you might need to control the style of the element wrapper. This is that orange box that shows around your custom element when you select it in the editor. Because your custom element is nested inside this element wrapper, it can affect the way your custom element is displayed, and you might need to make some adjustments to the styles of the wrapper itself.
To do that, you can provide the `baseStyles` property inside the options of the `createRenderer` function. This property accepts an object with CSS properties, which will be applied to the element wrapper.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { createRenderer } from "@webiny/app-page-builder-elements";
import MyCustomPlugin from "./components/MyCustomPlugin";

export const RandomPlugin = createRenderer(() => {
  return <MyCustomPlugin/>;
}, {
  // add min-height property to the element wrapper
  baseStyles:{
    minHeight: 2000,
  }
});
```

### Set default style property for your custom element

In another case, you might need to set certain style properties of your custom element to specific values. For example, by default, if you drop in an element into the editor its height is set to `100%`. But what if you have a case where you want your specific element to say have a default height of `250px`, you can take the following approach. Inside `<PbEditorPageElementPlugin>` you can define the `data.settings` property and set the default value for the height property, or for any other property that you want to set.

In this particular case, since the Page Builder controls the height property per device breakpoint you need to import both `createInitialPerDeviceSettingValue` and `DisplayMode` to correctly set the `height` property. 


``` js
import React from "react";
import {
    PbEditorPageElementPlugin,
    DisplayMode,
    PbEditorPageElementAdvancedSettingsPlugin
} from "@webiny/app-page-builder/types";
import { createInitialPerDeviceSettingValue } from "@webiny/app-page-builder/editor/plugins/elementSettings/elementSettingsUtils";

export default [
    {
        name: "pb-editor-my-custom-element",
        type: "pb-editor-page-element",

        // ... trimmed for brevity
        create(options) {
            return {
                type: "my-custom-element",
                elements: [],
                data: {
                    settings: {
                        // set height to 250px by default
                        height: createInitialPerDeviceSettingValue(
                            { value: "250px" },
                            DisplayMode.DESKTOP
                        )
                    }
                },
                ...options
            };
        }
    } as PbEditorPageElementPlugin,
];

```
