## Overview

Webiny CLI (command line interface) is the central tool that you'll be using throughout the complete project development process, in your terminal of choice.

Out of the box, it offers a couple of commands that will let you perform essential tasks like deployments, development and production code builds, different scaffolding, and so on.

Additionally, the Webiny CLI is pluggable, meaning you can easily create your own custom commands, or even replace the existing ones. Please visit the [Adding Custom Commands](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/extending-and-customizing/adding-custom-cli-commands) guide for more information.

  For a full list of commands, in your terminal of choice, make sure to run:
  ```bash 
  yarn webiny --help
  ```

## FAQ

### Do I need to install Webiny CLI manually?

No, Webiny CLI comes set up automatically with every new Webiny project.

### Do I need to invoke the Webiny CLI with `yarn`?

For the highest chance that everything will work as expected, we recommend you do so. But do note that if you're using some of the alternative terminals, like for example [Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), you might even get away without it.
