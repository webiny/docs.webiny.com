## Introduction

Out of the box, Webiny's Page Builder app provides a plethora of ready-made page elements we can use to create both simple and complex pages for our website. Furthermore, on top of the default set, users can also create their custom page elements, which is what this article demonstrates.

In this short article, we create a relatively simple page element that allows users to show a list of different [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) rocket and dragon spacecrafts. Here's what the final result will look like:

![SpaceX Page Element](./assets/create-a-page-element/preview.png)

The custom page element will be available from the **Media** page elements category:

<Image
  title="SpaceX Page Element in the Elements Menu (Media category)"
  src={elementInSidebar}
  style={{ width: 450 }}
/>

Also, upon dropping the element onto a page, users will have the ability to adjust the following three settings:

1. type of spacecrafts to be displayed (rockets or dragons)
2. number of spacecrafts to be displayed
3. pagination offset (number of spacecrafts we want to skip when retrieving the data)

<Image title="Page Element Settings" src={elementSettings} style={{ width: 450 }} />

Note that the spacecrafts data will be retrieved from a non-official public SpaceX GraphQL HTTP API, located at https://spacex-production.up.railway.app/. Meaning, changing these settings will dictate the variables that will be included in GraphQL queries issued by the page element. More on this in the following sections.

## Overview

### React Component

To create a custom page element, the first step is to create a React component that renders it. As we'll be able to see, this is easily achieved via the [`createRenderer`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.40.0/packages/app-page-builder-elements/src/createRenderer.tsx) factory function.

### Registering the Renderer

Via a couple of React components, the next step is registering the renderer React component within our project's **Admin** and **Website** apps.

For this, we'll be utilizing the [`admin.tsx`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/page-builder/custom-page-elements/extensions/spaceXElement/src/admin.tsx) and [`website.tsx`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/page-builder/custom-page-elements/extensions/spaceXElement/src/website.tsx) entry points, that the Page Builder element extension has created for us. Within these files, we'll be registering the renderer React component via the `PbEditorPageElementPlugin` and `PbRenderElementPlugin` React components.

## Implementation

### Renderer React Component

As previously mentioned, in order to create a custom page element, we start off by creating a new renderer React component. To do that, we create the [`extensions/spaceXElement/src/SpaceX.tsx`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/page-builder/custom-page-elements/extensions/spaceXElement/src/SpaceX.tsx) file with the following code:

```tsx extensions/spaceXElement/src/SpaceX.tsx
import React from "react";
import { request } from "graphql-request";
import { 
  createRenderer,
  useRenderer,
  useLoader 
} from "@webiny/app-page-builder-elements";

// For simplicity, we're hard-coding the GraphQL HTTP API URL here.
const GQL_API_URL = "https://spacex-production.up.railway.app/";

// These are the necessary GraphQL queries we'll need in order to retrieve data.
const QUERIES = {
    rockets: /* GraphQL */ `
        query listRockets($limit: Int, $offset: Int) {
            data: rockets(limit: $limit, offset: $offset) {
                id
                name
                description
                wikipedia
            }
        }
    `,
    dragons: /* GraphQL */ `
        query listDragons($limit: Int, $offset: Int) {
            data: dragons(limit: $limit, offset: $offset) {
                id
                name
                description
                wikipedia
            }
        }
    `
};

export interface Spacecraft {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    description: string;
    wikipedia: string;
}

// It's often useful to type the data that the page element will carry.
export interface SpaceXElementData {
    variables: {
        limit: string;
        offset: string;
        type: "rockets" | "dragons";
    };
}

// The renderer React component.
export const SpaceX = createRenderer(() => {
    // Let's retrieve the variables that were chosen by
    // the user upon dropping the page element onto the page.
    const { getElement } = useRenderer();
    const element = getElement<SpaceXElementData>();
    const { limit, offset, type } = element.data.variables;

    // This is where we fetch the data and store it into component's state.
    const { data, loading } = useLoader<Spacecraft[]>(
        () => {
            return request(GQL_API_URL, QUERIES[type], {
                limit: parseInt(limit),
                offset: parseInt(offset)
            }).then(res => res.data);
        },
        { cacheKey: [limit, offset, type] }
    );

    if (loading) {
        return <>Loading...</>;
    }

    if (!data?.length) {
        return <>Nothing to show.</>;
    }

    // If the data has been retrieved, we render it via a simple unordered list.
    return (
        <ul>
            {data.map(item => (
                <li key={item.id}>
                    <h1>{item.name}</h1>
                    <div>{item.description}</div>
                    <br />
                    <div>
                        More info at&nbsp;
                        <a href={item.wikipedia} target={"_blank"} rel={"noreferrer"}>
                            {item.wikipedia}
                        </a>
                    </div>
                </li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    );
});

```

As we can see in the code, in order to be able to issue remote GraphQL queries, we're using the [`graphql-request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-request) library, which we've specified as our extension's dependency upon running the [`webiny extension`](/docs/core-development-concepts/basics/webiny-cli#yarn-webiny-extension) command in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section. 

Note that our GraphQL query is called within the `useLoader` React hook. This is important because, essentially, this enables proper data caching when the page is published. This way, the page element is rendered efficiently, without the need to re-fetch the data each time the page is loaded.

<Alert>

  Learn more about the `useLoader` React hook in a separate article: [Loading Data in Page Elements](/docs/{version}/page-builder/extending/loading-data-in-page-elements).

</Alert>

Finally, we've created a simple unordered list to display the data that has been retrieved. The data is displayed in the form of a list of spacecrafts, with each item containing the spacecraft's name, description, and a link to its Wikipedia page. 

So, with this code in place, we're ready for the next step, which is registering the renderer React component within our **Admin** and **Website** apps.

### Admin App

Registering our custom page element within the **Admin** app is done via the [`extensions/spaceXElement/ksrc/admin.tsx`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/page-builder/custom-page-elements/extensions/spaceXElement/src/admin.tsx) entry point file, via three React components.

The first one is the `PbEditorPageElementPlugin` component, which is used to register the renderer React component within the page editor. The second one is the `PbRenderElementPlugin` component, which is used to register the renderer React component within the **Admin** app, outside the page editor. This is important because pages can also be previewed within the **Admin** app, for example:

![Page Preview In the Admin App](./assets/create-a-page-element/admin-page-preview.png)

Finally, the `PbEditorPageElementAdvancedSettingsPlugin` React component is used to register the advanced settings React component within the page editor.

<Image title="Page Element Settings" src={elementSettings} style={{ width: 450 }} />

The following code snippet shows the contents of the [`extensions/spaceXElement/src/admin.tsx`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/page-builder/custom-page-elements/extensions/spaceXElement/src/admin.tsx) file:

```tsx extensions/spaceXElement/src/admin.tsx
import React from "react";
import {
    PbEditorPageElementAdvancedSettingsPlugin,
    PbEditorPageElementPlugin,
    PbRenderElementPlugin
} from "@webiny/app-page-builder";
import { SpaceX, SpaceXElementData } from "./SpaceX";
import { OnCreateActions } from "@webiny/app-page-builder/types";
import { AdvancedSettings } from "./admin/AdvancedSettings";

const INITIAL_ELEMENT_DATA: SpaceXElementData = {
    variables: { type: "rockets", limit: "10", offset: "0" }
};

export const Extension = () => (
    <>
        <PbRenderElementPlugin elementType={"spaceX"} renderer={SpaceX} />
        <PbEditorPageElementPlugin
            elementType={"spaceX"}
            renderer={SpaceX}
            toolbar={{
                // We use `pb-editor-element-group-media` to put our new
                // page element into the Media group in the left sidebar.
                title: "SpaceX",
                group: "pb-editor-element-group-media",
                preview() {
                    // We can return any JSX / React code here. To keep it
                    // simple, we are simply returning the element's name.
                    return <>Space X Page Element</>;
                }
            }}
            // Defines which types of element settings are available to the user.
            settings={[
                "pb-editor-page-element-settings-delete",
                "pb-editor-page-element-settings-visibility",
                "pb-editor-page-element-style-settings-padding",
                "pb-editor-page-element-style-settings-margin",
                "pb-editor-page-element-style-settings-width",
                "pb-editor-page-element-style-settings-height",
                "pb-editor-page-element-style-settings-background"
            ]}
            // Defines onto which existing elements our element can be dropped.
            // In most cases, using `["cell", "block"]` will suffice.
            target={["cell", "block"]}
            onCreate={OnCreateActions.OPEN_SETTINGS}
            // `create` function creates the initial data for the page element.
            create={options => {
                return {
                    type: "spaceX",
                    elements: [],
                    data: INITIAL_ELEMENT_DATA,
                    ...options
                };
            }}
        />
        <PbEditorPageElementAdvancedSettingsPlugin
            elementType={"spaceX"}
            element={<AdvancedSettings />}
        />
    </>
);
```

With this code in place, our custom page element should be available within the page editor, and also within the **Admin** app itself, where pages are previewed.

Before jumping into our browser to see the results though, let's also register the renderer React component within the **Website** app.

### Website App

In order for our custom renderer React component to be used in a page on our public website, we need to register it via the `PbRenderElementPlugin` plugin, via the [`website.tsx`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/page-builder/custom-page-elements/extensions/spaceXElement/src/website.tsx) entry point file:

```tsx extensions/spaceXElement/src/website.tsx
import React from "react";
import { PbRenderElementPlugin } from "@webiny/app-website";
import { SpaceX } from "./SpaceX";

export const Extension = () => <PbRenderElementPlugin elementType={"spaceX"} renderer={SpaceX} />;
```

And that's all there is to it. With this code in place, we can now jump into our browser and see the results.

## Testing

With the above steps correctly completed, we should be able to see our custom page element in Page Builder's page editor and be able to drop it onto a page. 

<Video src={elementInEditor} controls={true} />

The page element should also be correctly rendered when previewing the page, and also on the public website, once the page has been published.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've created a simple page element that retrieves data from a public SpaceX GraphQL HTTP API. We've also seen how to register the renderer React component within the **Admin** and **Website** apps, so that the page element can be used within the page editor, and also on the public website.

Of course, this is just a starting point. We encourage you to experiment further and create more complex page elements that can be used to create rich and engaging pages for your website.
