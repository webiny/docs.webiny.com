  - how to load data in Page Builder elements

</Alert>


## Introduction

It's not uncommon to have a custom page element that loads data from an external remote HTTP API and displays it on the page.  

For example, you might want to display a list of products or a list of blog posts that are loaded from [Webiny's Headless CMS GraphQL API](/docs/headless-cms/basics/graphql-api). Another examples is listing rocket and dragon spacecrafts from an external SpaceX API, which is covered in the [Create a Custom Page Element](/docs/page-builder/extending/create-a-page-element) guide.

In this guide, we'll show you how to efficiently load data in Page Builder elements using the `useLoader` React hook.

## The `useLoader` React Hook

The `useLoader` React hook is a utility hook that helps you load data in custom page elements. It's main purpose is to ensure that, once the data is loaded in the page prerendering process, it is captured and properly cached. This way, the loaded data is immediately available when the published page is delivered to the end user, which improves page performance and user experience.

<Alert title={"Page Prerendering"}>

  Pages created with the Webiny' Page Builder are prerendered when published. This means that the page is generated as a static HTML file and served to the end user. This is done to ensure the best possible performance and SEO.

### How It Works

To better illustrate the difference between loading data with and without the `useLoader` hook, we can take a look at the following videos. 

Both videos show a custom page element that loads a list of countries from a remote API. The first video shows the page element loading the data without the `useLoader` hook, while the second video shows the page element loading the data with the `useLoader` hook.

  <Image src={dataLoadedWithoutLoader} alt={<>Loading data without the <code>useLoader</code> hook</>} />
  <Image src={dataLoadedWithLoader} alt={<>Loading data with the <code>useLoader</code> hook</>} />
</Gallery>

As we can see, in the first video, in the network tab, the request for the `countries.json` file is made after the page is rendered. This causes the data to be displayed in the custom page element after the page is rendered, which results in a flicker effect. In the second video, the data is immediately available when the page is rendered, which results in a smooth and seamless user experience. 

## Using the `useLoader` React Hook

Let's analyze the code that was used to create the page element we saw in the videos above. More specifically, we'll be looking at the code of the React component that renders the custom page element.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { createRenderer, useLoader } from "@webiny/app-page-builder-elements";

// The renderer React component.
export const CountriesPageElement = createRenderer(() => {
    const { data, loading } = useLoader<string[]>(() => {
        // Returns a list of strings.
        return fetch('https://my-api.com/countries.json').then(res => res.json())
    });

    if (loading) {
        return <>Loading...</>;
    }

    if (!data) {
        return <>No countries found.</>;
    }

    return (
        <>
            {data.map(countryName => (
                <span
                    key={countryName}
                    style={{
                        width: 130,
                        padding: 4,
                        display: "inline-block",
                        textOverflow: "ellipsis",
                        whiteSpace: "nowrap",
                        overflow: "hidden"
                    }}
                >
                    {countryName}
                </span>
            ))}
        </>
    );
});
```

As we can see, the `useLoader` hook is used to load the data from the `https://my-api.com/countries.json` endpoint. Within the hook, we use the [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) function to make a request to the endpoint and load the data, which is just an array of strings (country names).

Ultimately, the hook returns an object with two properties: `data` and `loading`. The `data` property contains the loaded data, while the `loading` property is a boolean that indicates whether the data is still being loaded.

In the React component, we first check if the data is still loading. If it is, we display a **Loading...** message. If the data is not loading, we check if the data is available. If it is, we map over the array of country names and display them in a list. If the data is not available, we display a **No countries found.** message.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we learned how to efficiently load data in Page Builder elements using the `useLoader` React hook. By using this hook, we can ensure that the data is loaded in the page prerendering process and is immediately available when the published page is delivered to the end user. This improves page performance and user experience.
