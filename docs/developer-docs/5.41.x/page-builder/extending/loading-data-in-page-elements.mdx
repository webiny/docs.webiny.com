## Introduction

It's not uncommon to have a page element that loads data from an external remote HTTP API and displays it on the page.  

For example, you might want to display a list of products or a list of blog posts that are loaded from [Webiny's Headless CMS GraphQL API](/docs/headless-cms/basics/graphql-api). Another examples is listing rocket and dragon spacecrafts from an external SpaceX API, which is covered in the [Create a Custom Page Element](/docs/page-builder/extending/create-a-page-element) guide.


In this guide, we'll show you how to efficiently load data in Page Builder elements using the `useLoader` React hook.
