- how to add custom folder fields to the Headless Cms
- how to control field rendering in the UI

</WhatYouWillLearn>

## Overview

Developers can extend the GraphQL schema and the Admin app's user interface by adding custom fields. Since our Headless CMS powers Folders under the hood, introducing a new field is as simple as defining it on the `Folder` model.

Once the field is defined in the model, it will automatically appear in the GraphQL schema under the `extensions` field. Additionally, this new field will be available in the user interface for creating and editing Folders, alongside default fields like `title`, `slug`, and `parentId`.

## Add a Field

To add a new field, use the `createCmsFolderModelModifier` plugin factory, provided by the `@webiny/api-headless-cms-aco` package.

```diff-ts apps/api/graphql/src/index.ts
import {
    createAcoHcmsContext,
+   createCmsFolderModelModifier
} from "@webiny/api-headless-cms-aco";

export const handler = createHandler({
    plugins: [
        // Other plugins were omitted for clarity.

        // Add the following code after your existing plugins.
+       createCmsFolderModelModifier(({ modifier }) => {
+           modifier.addField({
+               id: "carMake",
+               fieldId: "carMake",
+               label: "Car Make",
+               type: "text",
+               renderer: {
+                   name: "text-input"
+               }
+           });

+           modifier.addField({
+               id: "year",
+               fieldId: "year",
+               label: "Year of manufacturing",
+               type: "number",
+               renderer: {
+                   name: "number-input"
+               }
+           });
        })
    ],
    http: { debug }
});
```

In this example, we add two fields: `carMake` and `year`. You can add as many fields as you like. The field definition is identical to that of the Headless CMS model field, and all the same rules and options apply. To learn more about programmatic model and field definition, visit [Define Content Models via Code](/docs/{version}/headless-cms/extending/content-models-via-code).

Once the code shown above is applied, you need to deploy your API. Make sure to use the `--env` value that corresponds to your development environment.

This plugin is specifically designed to add fields to folders related to CMS content models. It includes an optional `modelIds` property (`string[]`), allowing you to target specific models.

In GraphQL, this plugin prefixes field IDs with `cms_` by default. If the `modelIds` property is specified, the field ID is prefixed with `cms_${modelId}_`.

```shell
yarn webiny deploy api --env=dev
```

After the deployment is done, your new fields should be visible in the GraphQL schema, and the UI, as demonstrated in the [Overview](#overview) section of this article.

## Customize Field Rendering

To control how and when a particular field is rendered, you need to configure a field decorator. Decorators are higher order components that allow you to intercept the component, and add custom logic to the rendering process.

The following code example shows how to create a field decorator, which is only applied to a specific field, when a folder is edited. When the conditions are met, a custom renderer will be applied to that particular field.

```diff-tsx apps/admin/src/App.tsx
import React from "react";
import { Admin } from "@webiny/app-serverless-cms";
import { Cognito } from "@webiny/app-admin-users-cognito";
+ import { ContentEntryListConfig } from "@webiny/app-headless-cms";
+ import { useForm } from "@webiny/form";
+ import type { FolderItem } from "@webiny/app-aco/types";
import "./App.scss";

+ const { Browser } = ContentEntryListConfig;

+ const ExtensionFieldDecorator = Browser.Folder.ExtensionField.createDecorator(Original => {
+   return function FieldDecorator(props) {
+     const form = useForm<FolderItem>();
+ 
+     if (form.data.id) {
+       return null;
+     }
+ 
+     return <Original {...props} />;
+   };
+ });

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <Admin>
      <Cognito />
+     <ContentEntryListConfig>
+       <ExtensionFieldDecorator id={"cms_year"} />
+     </ContentEntryListConfig>
    </Admin>
  );
};
```

The `useForm` hook provides access to the current form rendered inside the New/Edit Folder dialog. Using this approach, you can conditionally show or hide fields depending on any folder or form property, swap field renderers like we did in our code example, check for user permissions, etc.

The `ContentEntryListConfig` is a component which provides access to other components and utilities to configure the Headless Cms List view. You need to mount it as a parent of other config components, to correctly apply the configurations (as shown in the code example).

Once you run your Admin app, and navigate to the desired Content Model, edit an existing folder to see your custom renderer in action. The demonstrated custom renderer might not be the most exciting one, but it shows how you can dynamically apply different renderers depending on the folder and form context.
