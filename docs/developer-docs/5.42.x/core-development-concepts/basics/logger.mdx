## Overview

Webiny logger is internal feature which we use to log errors and other information into a DynamoDB Log table.

For Logger to work, we deploy a new DynamoDB table called `webiny-logs`.

## How to Use Logger

To use the Logger in your project, you can access it from the Webiny context.

There are multiple levels of logging available:
  - `debug`
  - `notice`
  - `info`
  - `warn`
  - `error`

When you want to log something, you can use the following code:

```typescript
import type {Context} from "./types";
import {ContextPlugin} from "@webiny/handler-aws";

const myCustomPlugin = new ContextPlugin<Context>(async context => {
    // some custom code
    try {
      await someAsyncFunction();
    } catch(ex) {
      const log = context.logger.withSource("where-did-the-log-come-from");
      // it will log the message with the source "where-did-the-log-come-from"
      // and the level "error"
      log.error({
        message: "Something is wrong with my custom code!",
        error: ex
      });
      // maybe rethrow it?
      throw ex;
    }
});
```

Note that the `where-did-the-log-come-from` is your custom string, which identifies where the log was created.

This is something you can use to filter logs later.

## How to Access Logger Logs?

There are two ways to access the logs:
  - directly from the DynamoDB table `webiny-logs`
  - using the GraphQL API

### DynamoDB Table

You can access the logs directly from the DynamoDB table `webiny-logs`. The table has the following structure:

```ts
interface Log {
  id: string;
  createdOn: string;
  tenant: string;
  locale: string;
  source: string;
  type: string;
  // this is the data that was logged - it's always compressed
  data: {
    compression: "GZIP",
    value: string// compressed value
  };
}
```

The data is always compressed using GZIP, so you must decompress it before you can read it.

### GraphQL API

You can also access the logs using the GraphQL API on `/graphql` endpoint. There are multiple queries and mutations available:

 - `listLogs` - to list all logs
 - `getLog` - to get a single log
 - `deleteLog` - to delete a single
 - `deleteLogs` - to delete multiple logs
 - `pruneLogs` - to delete all logs older than 60 seconds

#### List Logs

To list all logs, you can use the `listLogs` query. Here is an example of the query:

```graphql
query ListLogs {
  logs {
    listLogs(
        where: {
          tenant: "root",
          source:"myCustomSource",
          type: error
        },
        sort: DESC,
        limit: 100,
        after: "cursorFromPreviousRequest"
) {
      data {
        id
        type
        source
        data
        createdOn
      }
      error {
        message
        code
        data
        stack
      }
      meta {
        hasMoreItems
        cursor
      }
    }
  }
}
```
All arguments in `listTags` query are optional.

You can filter the logs by `tenant`, `source` and `type`. Or you can just list all logs, without any filtering applied.

#### Prune Logs

To delete all logs older than 60 seconds, you can use the `pruneLogs` mutation. Here is an example of the mutation:

```graphql
mutation PruneLogs {
  logs {
    pruneLogs {
      data {
        task {
          id
        }
      }
      error {
        message
        code
        data
        stack
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `pruneLogs` mutation will actually start a background task that will delete the logs. The task ID will be returned in the response, so you can track its progress.

If you try to prune logs while another prune task is running, you will get an error.
