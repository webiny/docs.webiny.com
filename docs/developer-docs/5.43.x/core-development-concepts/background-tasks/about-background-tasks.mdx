- what are Background Tasks

</WhatYouWillLearn>

## Overview

In the 5.39.0 version of Webiny we have introduced a Background Task feature.

This feature enables our users to run operations which take a long time to finish - more than available `15 minutes` maximum run time of the AWS Lambda.

The Background Task run limit is `1 year`, from the time when the task is triggered, which is the maximum execution time for the `AWS Step Function`.

This functionality uses the `AWS Event Bridge`, `AWS Step Function` and `AWS Lambda`.

## AWS Services Used in the Background Tasks

<Alert title="Resumable Background Tasks" type="warning">
  Currently, Background Tasks are not using the Task Token, so they are not resumable. We will be
  working on the solution for this in the future.
