- how to connect to the Remote Webiny MCP Server for enhanced AI assistance

</Alert>

In this chapter, you'll learn how you can use AI assistants and Remote MCP Server effectively in your Webiny development workflow.

## Webiny MCP Server

The Webiny documentation provides a remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows you to find information from the Webiny documentation right in your IDEs or AI tools, such as Cursor.
You can ensure your AI tools have current Webiny knowledge through the Webiny MCP server. This provides real-time access to the latest documentation, helping AI tools avoid outdated recommendations and ensuring they understand current best practices.

<Alert type="info" title="What is MCP?">

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) is a standardized way for AI tools to access external tools and data sources.

</Alert>


### Server Details

- **Name**: Webiny Docs
- **URL**: `https://mcp.docs.webiny.com/mcp`
- **Transport**: Streamable HTTP

You can add it to AI agents that support connecting to MCP servers.

### Cursor

[Click here](https://cursor.com/install-mcp?name=webiny&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5kb2NzLndlYmlueS5jb20vbWNwIn0K) to add the Webiny MCP server to Cursor.

To manually connect to the Webiny MCP server in Cursor, add the following to your `.cursor/mcp.json` file or Cursor settings, as explained in the [Cursor documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "webiny": {
      "url": "https://mcp.docs.webiny.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code

[Click here](https://vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=webiny&config=%7B%22type%22%3A%22http%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fmcp.docs.webiny.com%2Fmcp%22%7D) to add the Webiny MCP server to VS Code.

To manually connect to the Webiny MCP server in VS Code, add the following to your `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "webiny": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.docs.webiny.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Learn more in the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).

<Alert type="info" title="Additional One-Time Setup in VS Code">
  Sometimes, in VS Code, you may need to perform a one-time setup. When you ask a question and include a phrase like “use Webiny Docs”, then VS Code will prompt you to enable the Webiny MCP server for all sessions. Allow it, and the setup will be complete. This step is required only once. Please refer to the image below for reference.

### Claude Desktop

To connect to the Webiny MCP server in Claude Desktop, add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "webiny": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch",
        "https://mcp.docs.webiny.com/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Learn more in the [Claude Desktop documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use).

### Manual Setup

Many tools support a common JSON configuration format for MCP servers. If there are not specific instructions for your chosen tool, you may be able to add the Webiny Docs MCP server by including the following configuration in your tool's MCP settings:

**Streamable HTTP:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Webiny docs": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.docs.webiny.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Local Proxy:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Webiny docs": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.docs.webiny.com/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code CLI

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) is an agentic coding tool that runs on the command line. Enabling the Webiny Docs MCP server allows it to access the latest documentation while generating Webiny code.

### ChatGPT

<Alert type="warning" title="Limited availability">

MCP server integration is only available for ChatGPT Pro, Team, and Enterprise users. The setup process is more complex than other tools.

</Alert>

Refer to the [OpenAI MCP documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/mcp#test-and-connect-your-mcp-server) for specific setup instructions.

## Usage

Once configured, you can ask your AI tool questions about Webiny, and it will retrieve information directly from the latest docs. Coding agents will be able to consult the latest documentation when performing coding tasks, and chatbots will be able to accurately answer questions about Webiny features, APIs, and best practices.


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Verify that your tool supports streamable HTTP transport.
- Check that the server URL is correct: `https://mcp.docs.webiny.com/mcp`.
- Ensure your tool has proper internet access.
- Consult your specific tool's MCP integration documentation.

If you are still having problems, please reach out to our [community support channels](https://www.webiny.com/slack) for assistance.
