  - how to prevent accidental folder moves

</WhatYouWillLearn>

To help prevent accidental folder moves, Webiny introduces a confirmation dialog that can be enabled through configuration.

```tsx
import { FileManagerViewConfig } from "@webiny/app-file-manager";

// You can destructure child components to make the code more readable and easier to work with.
const { Browser } = FileManagerViewConfig;

<FileManagerViewConfig>
    <Browser.Folder.DropConfirmation value={true} />
</FileManagerViewConfig>
```

When active, this feature prompts users to confirm their action before moving a folder from one location to another. 

<Image src={folderDropConfirmation} title={"Confirm folder move: prompt appears before completing drag-and-drop."} />
