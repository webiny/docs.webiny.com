- how to upgrade Webiny from 5.8.0 to 5.9.0
:::

:::danger
Before continuing, make sure to take the necessary precautions, listed in the [Overview](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny/overview#-precaution-measures) section.
:::

:::info
Make sure to check out the [5.9.0 changelog](/docs/changelog/5.9.0) to get familiar with all the changes  introduced in this release.
:::

## 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

The first step is to upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages, which can be done by running the following command in the root of your project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.9.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.9.0`.

## 2. Run the Upgrade Command

Once all of the Webiny packages have been upgraded, continue by running the following upgrade command:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny upgrade 5.9.0
```

The upgrade script will make a couple of changes to your existing **API** project application's code (located within the `api` folder). Once the upgrade command has finished, you can run the [`git status`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) command to see all changes that the command performed.

:::info
Before running the `webiny upgrade` command, no active code changes must be present in your working branch.
:::

## 3. Deploy Your Project

Finally, proceed by re-deploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```

:::caution
As stated in the [Overview](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny/overview#pre-production-environments-first) section, we recommend that you first deploy your changes into one of your pre-production environments, like `dev` or `staging`.
