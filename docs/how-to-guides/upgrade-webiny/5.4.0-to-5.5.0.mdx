- how to upgrade Webiny from 5.4.0 to 5.5.0
:::

:::danger
Before continuing, make sure to take the necessary precautions, listed in the [Overview](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny/overview#-precaution-measures) section.
:::

:::info
Make sure to check out the [5.5.0 changelog](/docs/changelog/5.5.0) to get familiar with all the changes  introduced in this release.

## Upgrade Webiny Packages

The first step is to upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages, which can be done by running the following command in the root of your project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.5.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.5.0`.

## Upgrade Webiny Project

This release includes a couple of smaller changes on the project organization level. To make it easier, we provide a simple [Webiny CLI](/docs/key-topics/webiny-cli) command that will automatically make all the necessary adjustments for you.

Once you've run the above upgrade command, run the following:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny upgrade 5.5.0
```

:::info
Before running the `webiny upgrade` command, we recommend that you commit any active code changes you might have in your working branch.

### Additional Manual Upgrade Steps

Once the `webiny upgrade` command has finished, three manual steps remain to be completed, after which, your project should be completely updated.

You can then proceed by committing the changes to your working branch and trying to [deploy](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project) the project to one of the development or pre-production environment.

#### 1. Add `apolloLinks.ts` file (located in your Website project application)

In your **Website** project application (`apps/website`), we need to add the new [`apolloLinks.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/apps/website/code/src/plugins/apolloLinks.ts) file, that contains a couple of plugins, necessary for resolving a couple of pre-rendering related [issues](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1569).

Copy and paste the above mentioned `apolloLinks.ts` file to `apps/website/code/src/plugins/apolloLinks.ts`, and also, make sure it's imported in the [index.ts](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/apps/website/code/src/plugins/index.ts), located in the same `plugins` folder:

```ts title="apps/website/code/src/plugins/index.ts" {5,9}
import { plugins } from "@webiny/plugins";
import imageComponent from "@webiny/app/plugins/image";
import pageBuilder from "./pageBuilder";
import formBuilder from "./formBuilder";
import apolloLinks from "./apolloLinks";

import theme from "theme";

plugins.register([imageComponent(), pageBuilder, formBuilder, apolloLinks(), theme()]);
```

#### 2. Update `Page` React component (located in your Website project application)

Open your `/apps/website/code/src/components/Page/index.tsx` file and replace its content with [the new one](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/apps/website/code/src/components/Page/index.tsx). This change is also related to new pre-rendering related fixes.

#### 3. Optionally, add necessary environment variables to enable newly introduced logs forwarding

The new `webiny watch` command enables you to [stream logs](/docs/changelog/5.5.0#logs) from your application code directly to your terminal. And while all new projects will have this feature automatically enabled, there is one manual step that needs to be done for projects that are making the upgrade to version `5.5.0`.

In [api/pulumi/dev/index.ts](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/api/pulumi/dev/index.ts), upon instantiating both `Graphql` and `HeadlessCMS` classes, make sure to pass the `WEBINY_LOGS_FORWARD_URL: String(process.env.WEBINY_LOGS_FORWARD_URL)` as an environment variable.

This will enable logs forwarding for your main GraphQL API and HeadlessCMS GraphQL API Lambda functions.

## Upgrade Headless CMS Permissions
After a successful deployment, open your Admin Area to execute the automated upgrade of Headless CMS permissions. It will update permissions data structure on user groups and API keys.

:::caution
We recommend verifying your CMS permissions after the upgrade, to make sure they reflect exactly what is expected.
