- how to create your custom layout and use it on a page

## Overview
A layout defines the content hierarchy. It is a pattern that defines a website’s structure. It provides clear paths for navigation within webpages and puts the most important elements of a website front and center.

The most used layouts consist of three parts:
- header at the top containing links that help users to navigate around the website
- page content in the center
- footer at the very bottom containing various information about the website

## Using Layout in Page Builder
Layouts are linked to page categories. When you create a page category, say "Blog", you need to select a layout inside which that content will be displayed.
The options available inside the layout dropdown are registered by the [`pb-page-layout`](/docs/references/page-builder/plugins#pb-page-layout) plugin.

Each page created inside the "Blog" category, by default, use that layout.
However, inside the page settings, you can overwrite that on a per-page basis if you need to.

## Layout internals

A layout is a simple React component that receives several props. Here is an example of the static layout which comes with the default theme:

```ts title="apps/theme/pageBuilder/layouts/Static.tsx"
import React from "react";
import Header from "../components/Header";
import Footer from "../components/Footer";
import { PbPageData } from "@webiny/app-page-builder/types";

type StaticProps = {
    children: React.ReactNode;
    settings: Record<string, any>;
    page: PbPageData;
};

const Static = ({ children, ...rest }: StaticProps) => {
    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <Header {...rest} />
            {children}
            <Footer {...rest} />
        </React.Fragment>
    );
};

export default Static;
```
As you can see from the example above, we simply render a `Header`, `Footer`, and page content in between.

If you are creating your own layout, the structure is all up to you.
You can insert any `DOM` structure with any custom CSS classes you require. You can also import and use pretty much any 3rd party NPM library here.

## Create Custom Layout
Now that we know what is a layout and what are its internals.
Let's create a custom layout of our own.

Create a new file named `SimpleLayout.tsx` inside `apps/theme/pageBuilder/layouts` and add the following content in it:

```ts title="apps/theme/pageBuilder/layouts/SimpleLayout.tsx"
import React from "react";
import Header from "../components/Header";
import { PbPageData } from "@webiny/app-page-builder/types";

type LayoutProps = {
    children: React.ReactNode;
    settings: Record<string, any>;
    page: PbPageData;
};

const SimpleLayout = ({ children, ...rest }: LayoutProps) => {
    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <Header {...rest} />
            {children}
        </React.Fragment>
    );
};

export default SimpleLayout;
```

Now we register this layout as the [`pb-page-layout`](/docs/references/page-builder/plugins#pb-page-layout) plugin.

```ts {2,27-35} title="apps/theme/pageBuilder/index.ts"
import StaticLayout from "./layouts/Static";
import SimpleLayout from "./layouts/SimpleLayout";

import { PbPageLayoutPlugin, PbThemePlugin } from "@webiny/app-page-builder/types";

export default [
    {
        type: "pb-theme",
        theme: {
            colors: {
                //(...)
            },
            elements: {
               //(...)
            }
        }
    } as PbThemePlugin,
    {
        name: "pb-page-layout-static",
        type: "pb-page-layout",
        layout: {
            name: "static",
            title: "Static page",
            component: StaticLayout
        }
    } as PbPageLayoutPlugin,
    {
        name: "pb-page-layout-simple",
        type: "pb-page-layout",
        layout: {
            name: "simple",
            title: "Simple Layout",
            component: SimpleLayout
        }
    } as PbPageLayoutPlugin
];
```

Let's add the newly created layout to our page in the editor. It looks as shown below:

<img
  src={require("./images/webiny-theme-custom-layout.gif").default}
  style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}
  alt="Webiny page builder custom layout"
/>
