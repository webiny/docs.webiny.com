This article guides you through configuring your AWS credentials for programmatic access. At the end of the tutorial, you will have your API keys and region configured to successfully deploy Webiny to your AWS cloud.

## Step 1: Create Your AWS Account

:::info Already have an account?
In that case skip to [step 2](#step-2-create-a-user-for-programmatic-access) to create your programmatic user.
:::

To create your AWS account and set up your IAM credentials we should first navigate to the [AWS Console page](https://aws.amazon.com/console/):

![aws-sign-in](./assets/configure-aws-credentials/aws-sign-in.png)

Next click on `Create a new AWS account`:

![aws-login](./assets/configure-aws-credentials/aws-login.png)

Now input your credentials and create your account:

![aws-register](./assets/configure-aws-credentials/aws-register.png)

---

## Step 2: Create a User for Programmatic Access

Once you're registered, login and head to the AWS Management Console and select **IAM** under **Security, Identity & Compliance**:

![aws-iam-selection](./assets/configure-aws-credentials/aws-iam-selection.png)

Click on **IAM** and select **Users** under **Access Management**:

![aws-iam-users](./assets/configure-aws-credentials/aws-iam-users.png)

Click on **Add user** to create the account with the IAM credentials:

![aws-create-user](./assets/configure-aws-credentials/aws-create-user.png)

Here you enter a 5-step process, and the first step is to create a `User name` for the credentials.
:::caution Programmatic access
Make sure to select the **Programmatic access** checkbox before moving to the next step.
:::

![aws-user-details](./assets/configure-aws-credentials/aws-user-details.png)

In the next step you define the access level for the new user. Select **Attach existing Policies** from the three options that are available. Then select the **AdministratorAccess** role by marking the checkbox next to it. When ready, click the `Next:Tags` button:

:::caution Want fine-grain permissions?
In case your organization can't use the `AdministratorAccess` or if you want to have a more strictly defined set of permissions,
please see the [attaching fine-grain policy](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/aws/configure-aws-credentials#attaching-a-fine-grain-policy) section.
:::

![aws-user-permissions](./assets/configure-aws-credentials/aws-user-permissions.png)

In case you don't want to add any tags to your new user, you can just skip this step and click the `Next:Review` button.

![aws-user-tags](./assets/configure-aws-credentials/aws-user-tags.png)

After all the steps are complete, you'll see a `Review` page. It should look something similar to this. If everything is correct, click the `Create user` button.

![aws-user-review](./assets/configure-aws-credentials/aws-user-review.png)

Lastly, you will receive a success message with your **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**. You need to copy these strings and keep them safe as you need them for the next step.

:::caution Save the credentials
Once you navigate off this screen, you will not be able to see the credentials any more. If you lose them, you will need to delete the user and create a new one.
:::

### Attaching a Fine-grain Policy

Alternatively, you can also define a fine-grain policy using our [CloudFormation template](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/docs/CWP_POLICY_CLOUDFORMATION_TEMPLATE.json)
that will create a **Group** with all the necessary policies, for a **Webiny** project and assign it to a given user.

:::info
Please note that a user with programmatic access is a prerequisite for this step.
If you don't have one please refer to the [previous step](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/aws/configure-aws-credentials#step-2-create-a-user-for-programmatic-access).
:::

Quickly [create stack](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://cf-templates-16wmwt5xsvalh-ap-southeast-1.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/CWP_POLICY_CLOUDFORMATION_TEMPLATE.json&stackName=Create-webiny-project)
using our CloudFormation template.
You will be prompted to enter the username, and it will create and attach the required policies to it, as shown below:

![aws-cloudformation-create-stack](./assets/configure-aws-credentials/create-stack.gif)

The resource creation will take a few minutes. After completion, you will see the completion logs:

![aws-cloudformation-step-5](./assets/configure-aws-credentials/cloudformation-step-5.png)

Afterwards, you can check out the newly created resources in the IAM service panel.
Also, if you head over to the previously created user `webiny-cli` in our case, you will see the attached policy and Group:

![aws-cloudformation-step-6](./assets/configure-aws-credentials/cloudformation-step-6.png)

## Step 3: Configure the Programmatic Access

Now that you have the **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** it's time to store them on your development machine.

---

### Unix setup

If you're on UNIX, create a folder named `.aws` inside your user folder, that's `~/.aws`. Inside that folder place a file called `credentials`. So the full path is `~/.aws/credentials`.

### Windows setup

On Windows machines, navigate to your user folder. That's `C:\Users\USERNAME\` (replace `USERNAME` with your actual username). Inside create a new folder named `.aws`, and inside the `.aws` folder create a file named `credentials`. The full path should be like this: `C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials`.

---

Now that we have our `credentials` file, edit the file and populate it like so:

```plain
[default]
aws_access_key_id = PASTE_ACCESS_KEY_ID_HERE
aws_secret_access_key = PASTE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
```

The word `default` inside the square brackets is your profile name. If you don't explicitly configure a profile name, the `default` profile is used by AWS CLI and SDK.

<!-- ## Step 4: Configure the default region

The last thing to configure is your default region. It's important to configure the region that is closest to your geographical location for optimal network latency. You can find which region is the most suitable for you using, for example, https://www.cloudping.info/.

To see the region codes, visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints.

If you don't want to bother with regions, use `us-east-1`.

---

### Unix setup

Inside your `.aws` folder, the one we created in the previous step, create a file called `config`. So the full path is `~/.aws/config`.

### Windows setup

Inside your `.aws` folder, the one we created in the previous step, create a file called `config`. The full path should be like this: `C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\config`.

---

Now that we have our `config` file, edit the file and populate it like so:

```plain
[default]
region = YOUR_AWS_REGION
```

This means that for your `default` profile, that particular region is used. -->

And that's it! You now have your AWS credentials, your default region, and you're ready to deploy Webiny.

## Using a Different AWS Profile Name

If you would like to use a different name for your AWS profile, you can do that too.

But do note that you will need to specify it before executing Webiny deployment-related commands, otherwise the `default` profile will be used.

You can do that via the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable, which you can set in a couple of ways. The easiest way to do it would be via the `.env` file, located in your project root, for example:

```
AWS_PROFILE=my-profile
```

Apart from that, the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable can also be specified using a terminal of your choice, and a command that's available on your operating system. For example, on Linux or MacOS, you can use the [`export`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/export-command-in-linux-with-examples/) command:

```
export AWS_PROFILE=my-profile
```

On Windows, you can utilize the [`set`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/set_1) and [`setx`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/setx) commands, for example:

```
setx AWS_PROFILE my-profile
```

:::info
Read more about profiles and how to set them up in the official [AWS documentation article](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html).
:::

Once the `AWS_PROFILE` has been properly set via one of the shown methods, you can proceed with the deployment of your Webiny project.

## FAQ

#### Is there a way to check if my profile was set properly?

If you have the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) installed on your system, you can run the following command:

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

This should give an output similar to the following:

```
{
    "Account": "x",
    "UserId": "y",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::x:user/z"
}
```
