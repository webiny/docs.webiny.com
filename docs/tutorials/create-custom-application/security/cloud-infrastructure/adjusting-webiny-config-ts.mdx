## Adjusting the `webiny.config.ts` Configuration File

There's one additional step we need to complete before we can finally start working on our React application code, and that's adjusting its [`webiny.config.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/create-custom-application/05-security/03-cloud-infrastructure/03-adjusting-webiny-config-ts/pinterest-clone/app/code/webiny.config.ts) configuration file, located in [`pinterest-clone/app/code`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/create-custom-application/05-security/03-cloud-infrastructure/03-adjusting-webiny-config-ts/pinterest-clone/app/code) folder. This is where we'll finally use all of the stack output properties that we've added in GraphQL API and React application cloud infrastructure code, and pass them as environment variables to our React application.

:::note
In order to continue, all of the cloud infrastructure additions we did in previous two sections need to be deployed.

:::note
Changes made to the [`webiny.config.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/create-custom-application/05-security/03-cloud-infrastructure/03-adjusting-webiny-config-ts/pinterest-clone/app/code/webiny.config.ts) file aren't automatically picked up by already active watch sessions, initialized with the [`webiny watch`](/docs/how-to-guides/use-watch-command) command. Before you start making any changes, make sure to terminate any active watch sessions you might have and run them again once the [`webiny.config.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/create-custom-application/05-security/03-cloud-infrastructure/03-adjusting-webiny-config-ts/pinterest-clone/app/code/webiny.config.ts) file is in the right place.

The following code highlights the changes that need to be performed:

```ts title="pinterest-clone/app/code/webiny.config.ts" {16-18,21-23,40-47,67-74}
import invariant from "invariant";
import { createWatchApp, createBuildApp } from "@webiny/project-utils";
import { getStackOutput } from "@webiny/cli-plugin-deploy-pulumi/utils";

// Exports fundamental start (watch) and build commands.
// Within both commands, we rely on the deployed GraphQL API (pinterest-clone/api) and its stack
// output to retrieve the URL over which the GraphQL API is accessible. If needed, additional
// information can be retrieved too, but remember to export it in the cloud infrastructure
// code, in the following files:
// - `pinterest-clone/api/pulumi/dev/index.ts`
// - `pinterest-clone/api/pulumi/prod/index.ts`

const API_MAP = {
    REACT_APP_API_URL: "${apiUrl}",
    REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_API_URL: "${apiUrl}/graphql",
    REACT_APP_USER_POOL_REGION: "${region}",
    REACT_APP_USER_POOL_ID: "${cognitoUserPool.id}",
    REACT_APP_USER_POOL_DOMAIN: "${cognitoUserPool.domain}"
};

const APP_MAP = {
    REACT_APP_USER_POOL_WEB_CLIENT_ID: "${cognitoUserPool.clientId}"
};

const NO_ENV_MESSAGE = `Please specify the environment via the "--env" argument, for example: "--env dev".`;

export default {
    commands: {
        async watch(options) {
            invariant(options.env, NO_ENV_MESSAGE);
            Object.assign(
                process.env,
                getStackOutput({
                    folder: "pinterest-clone/api",
                    env: options.env,
                    map: API_MAP
                })
            );

            Object.assign(
                process.env,
                getStackOutput({
                    folder: "pinterest-clone/app",
                    env: options.env,
                    map: APP_MAP,
                })
            );

            // Starts the local development server at port 3002.
            Object.assign(process.env, { PORT: 3002 });

            // Starts local application development.
            const watch = createWatchApp({ cwd: __dirname });
            await watch(options);
        },
        async build(options) {
            invariant(options.env, NO_ENV_MESSAGE);
            Object.assign(
                process.env,
                getStackOutput({
                    folder: "pinterest-clone/api",
                    env: options.env,
                    map: API_MAP
                })
            );

            Object.assign(
                process.env,
                getStackOutput({
                    folder: "pinterest-clone/app",
                    env: options.env,
                    map: APP_MAP,
                })
            );

            // Creates a production build of your application, ready to be deployed to
            // a hosting provider of your choice, for example Amazon S3.
            const build = createBuildApp({ cwd: __dirname });
            await build(options);
        }
    }
};
```

First, we've updated the existing [`API_MAP`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/create-custom-application/05-security/03-cloud-infrastructure/03-adjusting-webiny-config-ts/pinterest-clone/app/code/webiny.config.ts#L13) object, which is used upon retrieving our GraphQL API's stack output:

```ts
getStackOutput({
  folder: "pinterest-clone/api",
  env: options.env,
  map: API_MAP,
});
```

As the name itself suggests, the object represents a map. It is used to instruct the [`getStackOutput`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/create-custom-application/05-security/03-cloud-infrastructure/03-adjusting-webiny-config-ts/pinterest-clone/app/code/webiny.config.ts#L33) function to map the received stack output properties to new ones. This is useful because, in the [`watch`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/create-custom-application/05-security/03-cloud-infrastructure/03-adjusting-webiny-config-ts/pinterest-clone/app/code/webiny.config.ts#L29) and [`build`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/create-custom-application/05-security/03-cloud-infrastructure/03-adjusting-webiny-config-ts/pinterest-clone/app/code/webiny.config.ts#L52) commands, we're assigning stack output properties as environment variables, which must contain the `REACT_APP_` prefix in order for us to be able to access them within the actual React application code.

So, we've added three new properties to the `API_MAP` object: `REACT_APP_USER_POOL_REGION`, `REACT_APP_USER_POOL_ID`, and `REACT_APP_USER_POOL_DOMAIN`, which will represent the `region`, `cognitoUserPool.id`, and `cognitoUserPool.domain` properties included in the retrieved GraphQL API's stack output.

We also had to add a new [`APP_MAP`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/create-custom-application/05-security/03-cloud-infrastructure/03-adjusting-webiny-config-ts/pinterest-clone/app/code/webiny.config.ts#L21) map object for the properties that will be retrieved from our React application's stack output. This map is then used with the new [`getStackOutput`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/create-custom-application/05-security/03-cloud-infrastructure/03-adjusting-webiny-config-ts/pinterest-clone/app/code/webiny.config.ts#L42) function call, which has the `pinterest-clone/app` specified as the project application folder:

```ts
getStackOutput({
  folder: "pinterest-clone/app",
  env: options.env,
  map: APP_MAP,
});
```

## Restart Watch Session

Note that, in order for the performed changes to take effect and the new environment variables to become accessible in our React application code, we'll need to restart the watch session. So, if you had one active, in your terminal, simply stop it and start a new one, by running the [`webiny watch`](/docs/how-to-guides/use-watch-command/) command again:

```
yarn webiny watch pinterest-clone/app --env dev
```

## Note on Deploying into New Environments

Let's say we needed to deploy our React application, in its current state, into a brand new environment.

When doing that, note that the **first** deployment will always need to be done **twice**. This is because of the order in which the React application is built and the User Pool Client is deployed.

Under the hood, essentially, the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project) command performs two steps:

1. compile application code and create a production build of our application
2. based on the cloud infrastructure code, deploy our application and other defined resources

This means that upon deploying our React application for the first time, the [`getStackOutput`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/create-custom-application/05-security/03-cloud-infrastructure/03-adjusting-webiny-config-ts/pinterest-clone/app/code/webiny.config.ts#L65) function call, that we've added within the [`build`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/create-custom-application/05-security/03-cloud-infrastructure/03-adjusting-webiny-config-ts/pinterest-clone/app/code/webiny.config.ts#L52) command in our [`webiny.config.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/create-custom-application/05-security/03-cloud-infrastructure/03-adjusting-webiny-config-ts/pinterest-clone/app/code/webiny.config.ts) file, won't return any results. No deployed cloud infrastructure means no stack output to read from.

So, when doing the first deployment, we recommend you first deploy your cloud infrastructure resources only, and then proceed by doing another deployment, this time with the application code. We can achieve this with the following command:

```bash
yarn webiny deploy pinterest-clone/app --env new-environment --no-build && \
yarn webiny deploy pinterest-clone/app --env new-environment
```

Once the first deployment has been performed, the following deployments of our React application can be done as usual, with the single [`webiny deploy`](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project) execution:

```bash
yarn webiny deploy pinterest-clone/app --env new-environment
```

## Final Result

With all of the new stack output properties now being passed to our React application code as new environment variables, we're now ready to switch to our application code and begin integrating the Hosted UI authentication flow.

## FAQ

#### Is there a way to detect whether we're deploying our React application for the first time?

To determine whether the React application has been deployed or not, we can run the following [`webiny output`](/docs/key-topics/webiny-cli#yarn-webiny-output---env-env) command:

```bash
yarn webiny output pinterest-clone/app --env  --json
```

If the result is different from `"null"`, that would mean the application has been previously deployed.

:::note
Note that the returned `null` is actually a string. So, in your code or a CI/CD workflow step, make sure to do a string-based comparison (`=== "null"`).
