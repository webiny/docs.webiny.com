## Overview

Except being the first [serverless CMS](https://www.webiny.com/serverless-cms) out there, Webiny is also categorized as a [serverless application framework](https://www.webiny.com/serverless-application-framework). In other words, it is a framework that enables developers to architect, build, and deploy solutions on top of the serverless cloud infrastructure, like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), and others.

Some examples of what you can build with Webiny today are:

- full-stack applications
- websites
- REST and GraphQL APIs
- microservices
- and more

No matter what you end up building, it's worth pointing out that all of these different types of applications consist of two fundamental pieces: **application** and **cloud infrastructure** code.

**Application code** is your frontend and backend code. For example, a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application with all of its components, hooks, providers, and so on, is code that falls into this category. On the backend side, we also have [GraphQL API](https://graphql.org/) schema definition, resolver functions, and basically any type of business, authentication, and authorization logic that might be required.

**Cloud infrastructure code** defines the necessary cloud infrastructure resources that need to be deployed in order for the application to work and to be accessible by your users. It may include definitions of multiple different types of resources, like functions, databases, file storage, CDNs, and more.

:::note
We'll see both application code and cloud infrastructure code in action in the following sections of this tutorial.

:::tip
To deploy necessary cloud infrastructure, by default, Webiny relies on Pulumi, a modern infrastructure as code framework. Find out more in the following [IaC with Pulumi](/docs/key-topics/deployment/iac-with-pulumi) key topic.

How do you handle these two together as a single unit? Well, that's where Webiny serverless application framework comes in. By providing the proper tools, methodology and best practices, Webiny enables seamless integration between the two, and ultimately, enables developers to build powerful applications that sit on top of the serverless cloud infrastructure.

And that's what we'll be exploring in this tutorial, by building a completely custom application, from scratch. Let's see what we'll be building.

## The Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to learn how we can create a full stack application, using Webiny serverless application framework. More specifically, we'll be building a browser application that is essentially a clone of [Pinterest](https://help.pinterest.com/en/guide/all-about-pinterest), a popular website for finding ideas like recipes, home and style inspiration, and more.

Of course, we'll be building a much simpler version of it. The application will allow users to:

- sign up and sign in into the application
- create new **pins** which will consist of three pieces of information: title, description, and a cover image
- list and view pins created by themselves and other users

This is the end result we're aiming to achieve:

<CenteredImage src={viewPins} alt="The Pinterest Clone Application - Pins List" />

<CenteredImage src={viewPin} alt="The Pinterest Clone Application - Pin Details" />

For now, we won't go into the specifics of which tools and libraries we will use, but we will mention the application will be completely serverless.

## The Plan

Before we start doing any coding, let's quickly outline the plan we intend to follow over the next couple of sections of this tutorial.

<CenteredImage src={plan} canEnlarge={false} shadow={false} alt="Create Custom Application - The Plan" />

#### [Getting Started](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/getting-started)

We start our journey by introducing the [Full Stack Application](/docs/how-to-guides/scaffolding/full-stack-application) scaffold, which will create the two fundamental pieces of our application: the GraphQL API and the React application that's interacting with it.

We'll also dedicate a couple of sections on how to approach development using the [`webiny watch`](/docs/how-to-guides/use-watch-command) command, just so where all on the same page here.

#### [GraphQL API](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/graphql-api)

In this section, we start working on our GraphQL API, by extending it with the new `Pin` types and a basic set of related GraphQL query and mutation operations.

#### [React Application](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/react-application/introduction)

Once our GraphQL API is in place, we're ready to start working on our frontend React application. The section itself is also organized into five sections, ensuring we don't rush with any of the steps we need to cover.

#### [Security](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/security/introduction)

In this section, we show how we can secure our application by integrating [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/).

Apart from providing a way for users to sign up and sign in to the application, we also gain the ability to tie every created pin to a user, which we'll display in the application. Last but certainly not the least, we also get to implement necessary security (authorization) checks on the GraphQL API.

#### File Upload (coming soon)

In today's world, no application is complete without a file upload feature, so that's what we'll cover in this final section of this tutorial. By enabling users to attach an image to their pins, the whole website will become more lively and more pleasant to use.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this tutorial, you should have a solid understanding of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

On the frontend side, for anything styling-related, we'll use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), which is already included in every Webiny project. We'll also include the [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) React library to create the majority of the user interface. For both of these, a basic understanding will suffice.

Furthermore, we'll deploy our application to Amazon Web Services (AWS), where we'll rely on a couple of common and popular services like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), and more. In-depth knowledge of these service is not needed, but it is recommended to have at least a basic understanding of what they are used for.

Finally, note that you should have a new Webiny project set up on your machine, version `5.18.0` or greater.
