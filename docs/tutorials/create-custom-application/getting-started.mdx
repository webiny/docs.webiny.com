## Full Stack Application Scaffold

The best way to start building a new custom application would be to use the [Full Stack Application](/docs/how-to-guides/scaffolding/full-stack-application) scaffold, which will automatically generate all of the fundamental application pieces for us. This includes the following.

### GraphQL API

A new GraphQL API created within a new [project application](/docs/key-topics/project-organization/project-applications-and-packages) in our Webiny project (more information below). Once deployed, we will use the [Extend GraphQL API](/docs/tutorials/extend-admin-area/introduction) scaffold to extend it, meaning, create new GraphQL types, queries, and mutations.

Speaking of deployment, note that we'll need to deploy the newly created GraphQL API before jumping to React application development, simply because the React application relies on it. This is also something the [Full Stack Application](/docs/how-to-guides/scaffolding/full-stack-application) scaffold will warn us about, and will offer to do it for us.

In order to host the GraphQL API, these are the cloud infrastructure resources that will get deployed:

<CenteredImage
  shadow={false}
  alt="Cloud Infrastructure Resources"
  src={graphqlApiCloudInfrastructureDiagram}
/>

Note that we will expand this infrastructure with a couple of additional resources, in the following sections of this tutorial.

### React Application

A new React application created within a new [project application](/docs/key-topics/project-organization/project-applications-and-packages) in our Webiny project (more information below). Here, we won't be relying on any existing scaffolds. Instead, in order to recreate the original Pinterest application's user interface, we'll simply use our existing [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) knowledge. And, as mentioned, we'll also use the [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) React library, which will make the whole process a bit faster.

Note that, for development purposes, except having the GraphQL API deployed, we don't need to perform any additional deployments. Frontend application development, or, in our case, React application development, can still be performed locally, on the developer's machine. You only deploy it when you need to have it online.

In order to host the React application, these are the cloud infrastructure resources that will get deployed:

<CenteredImage
  shadow={false}
  alt="Cloud Infrastructure Resources"
  src={reactAppCloudInfrastructureDiagram}
/>

## Running the Scaffold

In our terminal of choice, from our project root, let's run the following command:

```
yarn webiny scaffold
```

Running this command should give us the following list of available scaffolds:

<CenteredImage alt="Scaffolds List" style={{ maxWidth: 650 }} src={scaffoldsList} />

Once we've selected the **Full Stack Application** scaffold from the list, we'll get presented with the the following three questions:

1. the name of the new full stack application
2. the description of the new full stack application
3. the path in which the new full stack application will be created

For the name, we'll go with **Pinterest Clone**. For description and path, we'll go with the provided defaults, where the path will automatically be set to **pinterest-clone**.

Once we've answered all of the questions, after a quick confirmation step, scaffolding will start. Once the process has been completed, we'll also be asked about whether we want to include a simple GraphQL API example in the created application code. For now, we can go with **no** here.

Furthermore, we'll also be asked about whether we want to immediately deploy the newly created GraphQL API. Here, it's recommended we go with **yes**, and that's what we'll do. Note that the scaffold will use `dev` as the target environment.

Ultimately, we should end up with the following output in our terminal:

<CenteredImage
  alt="Full Stack Application - Full Output"
  style={{ maxWidth: 750 }}
  src={fullStackAppScaffold}
/>

As we can see, the scaffold created the GraphQL API inside the [`pinterest-clone/api`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/create-custom-application/02-getting-started/pinterest-clone/api), and the React application inside the [`pinterest-clone/app`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/create-custom-application/02-getting-started/pinterest-clone/app) folder.

```bash
pinterest-clone
├── api                               # GraphQL API project application folder.
│   ├── code                          # Application code.
│   │   └── graphql                   # GraphQL API application code.
│   ├── pulumi                        # Cloud infrastructure code.
│   └── webiny.application.ts         # Project application's manifest file.
│
└── app                               # React application project application folder.
    ├── code                          # React application code.
    ├── pulumi                        # Cloud infrastructure code.
    └── webiny.application.ts         # Project application's manifest file.
```

Note that these folders are just [project application](/docs/key-topics/project-organization/project-applications-and-packages) folders. The actual application code will be located in [`pinterest-clone/api/code/graphql`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/create-custom-application/02-getting-started/pinterest-clone/api/code/graphql) and [`pinterest-clone/app/code`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/create-custom-application/02-getting-started/pinterest-clone/app/code) folders.

:::info
Project application folders can be easily recognized because they always contain the `webiny.application.ts` manifest file. In our case, these are [`pinterest-clone/api/webiny.application.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/create-custom-application/02-getting-started/pinterest-clone/api/webiny.application.ts) and [`pinterest-clone/app/webiny.application.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/create-custom-application/02-getting-started/pinterest-clone/app/webiny.application.ts).
:::

Also, take note of the [`pinterest-clone/api/pulumi`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/create-custom-application/02-getting-started/pinterest-clone/api/pulumi) and [`pinterest-clone/app/pulumi`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/create-custom-application/02-getting-started/pinterest-clone/app/pulumi) folders. This is where the cloud infrastructure code lives, and by default, it contains the definitions of all of the necessary resources that are needed in order for our application to run properly.

In the following sections, we'll be doing a couple of additions and modifications here, so stay tuned.

## Using the Watch Command

Once the scaffolding process has been completed, it's time to start building our application.

In order to do that effectively, we will need the [`webiny watch`](/docs/how-to-guides/use-watch-command) command, which ensures all of our application and cloud infrastructure code changes are detected, compiled, and automatically deployed into the cloud, when required.

Since two separate project applications were created in the scaffolding process, we'll need to run two separate [`webiny watch`](/docs/how-to-guides/use-watch-command) commands.

### GraphQL API

The following command will start a new watch session on our GraphQL API application code:

```bash
yarn webiny watch pinterest-clone/api --env dev
```

:::tip Misplaced GraphQL API URL?
Running the `yarn webiny output pinterest-clone/api --env dev` command from your project root will display all of the values that were exported from your cloud infrastructure code. That includes GraphQL API URL, Amazon DynamoDB table name, and more.
:::

### React Application

The following command will start a new watch session on our React application code:

```bash
yarn webiny watch pinterest-clone/app --env dev
```

:::tip
Once started, by default, the React application should be locally accessible via [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
:::

#### No Continuous Deployment Needed

In contrast to [GraphQL API](/docs/tutorials/extend-admin-area/getting-started#graphql-api) development, where the application code needs to be redeployed into the cloud as we're making changes to it, React application can be developed locally. Meaning, once the watch command is run, no automatic deployments will be performed.

#### Why the `--env` Argument?

Note that we need to specify the environment via the `--env` flag, even when watching the React application. This is because the [`watch`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/create-custom-application/02-getting-started/pinterest-clone/app/code/webiny.config.ts#L21) and [`build`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/create-custom-application/02-getting-started/pinterest-clone/app/code/webiny.config.ts#L31) scripts need to pick up some of the values exported from GraphQL API's cloud infrastructure code, for a specific environment. For example, in order to interact with the GraphQL API, the React application needs to know its URL. Since we could potentially have our GraphQL API deployed into several environments, we need to specify it.

:::tip
When we say _scripts need to pick up some of the values exported from GraphQL API's cloud infrastructure code_, we actually mean they need to retrieve our GraphQL API **stack output**. We'll revisit this term in one of the following sections, so you'll be able to get a better understanding of how it actually works.
:::

### Final Result

The following screenshot shows the two [`webiny watch`](/docs/how-to-guides/use-watch-command) commands run side-by-side in two separate terminal sessions:

<CenteredImage alt="Watching GraphQL API and React Application" src={watchCommands}/>

## Deployments

If, at any point, we just wanted to deploy our GraphQL API or React application, we can do that with the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project) command.

### GraphQL API

To deploy our GraphQL API, we can use the following command:

```bash
yarn webiny deploy pinterest-clone/api --env dev
```

### React Application

To deploy our React application, we can use the following command:

```bash
yarn webiny deploy pinterest-clone/app --env dev
```

## Environments

Note that, throughout the whole tutorial, we'll be using `dev` as the environment into which we'll deploy our GraphQL API and React application.

## FAQ

#### Which database is used in the generated GraphQL API application code?

The generated GraphQL API application code relies exclusively on [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) for storing and retrieving data. Of course, you're certainly free to bring your own databases and import different database clients, if need be. In essence, this will require you to remove the Amazon DynamoDB table definition in the cloud infrastructure code, and integrate the preferred database and a database client in your application code.

#### Do I need to deploy the created React application in order to continue development?

No. As mentioned above, frontend application development can still be performed locally, on the developer's machine. You only deploy the application when you need to have it online.

#### Into which environment the GraphQL API was deployed?

During the Full Stack Application scaffold's setup, we get to decide whether we want to immediately deploy the newly created GraphQL API or not. If we choose yes, the GraphQL API will automatically be deployed into the `dev` environment.
