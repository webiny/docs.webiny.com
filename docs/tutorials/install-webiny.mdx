:::tip WHAT YOU’LL LEARN
- how to create a brand new Webiny project
- how to deploy it to your [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account
:::

---

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have the following:

#### Node.js > 12

- any version equal or greater than **12**
- If you don't have Node.js installed, the easiest way to install it is by [downloading the official binary](https://nodejs.org/en/)

#### yarn ^1.22.0 || ^2

- Webiny works with both yarn versions [1 (classic)](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) and [2 (berry)](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- for version 1 - **1.22.0** or later is required
- for version 2 - **2.0.0** or later is required

#### AWS account and user credentials

- in order to deploy Webiny, you must have a valid [AWS account and user credentials](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/configure-aws-credentials) set up on your system

## Project Setup

Once you have all the prerequisites in place, we recommend creating a new Webiny project using `create-webiny-project` - a tool that sets everything up automatically for you. So, in your terminal of choice, run the following command:

```
npx create-webiny-project my-new-project
```

From there, follow the on-screen setup instructions, which includes answering a couple of project-related questions, and doing your first deployment.

## First Deployment

Once your new project has been created, it's time to deploy it into your AWS account.

To do that, in your terminal, navigate to your project folder, and run the following command:

```
yarn webiny deploy
```

By executing this command, all of the project applications will first get built, and, along with needed cloud infrastructure resources, deployed into your AWS account.

:::info Project Applications
Learn more about project applications and project organization in general, in the [Project Applications and Packages](/docs/key-topics/project-organization/project-applications-and-packages) key topic.
:::

:::tip Cloud Infrastructure
Learn what gets deployed into your AWS account and how it all works in the [Cloud Infrastructure](/docs/key-topics/cloud-infrastructure/introduction) key topics section.
:::

Note that the first deployment can take up to 20 minutes! So, even though it might look nothing is happening in the terminal, please be patient and let the process finish. If something went wrong, an error will be shown.

Finally, once the deployment has been done, you are presented with the URL over which you can access your Admin Area, and finish the installation.

:::info Misplaced Admin area URL?
Running the `yarn webiny info` command in your Webiny project folder will give you all of the relevant project URLs.
:::

:::caution Telemetry
Please note that, by default, Webiny collects anonymous usage information, which is exclusively used for improving the product and understanding usage patterns. Please take a look at our [Telemetry](https://www.webiny.com/telemetry/) page for more information on this subject.

If, at any point in time, you wish to disable this behaviour, you can do it with the [Webiny CLI](/docs/key-topics/webiny-cli), by running the following command: `yarn webiny disable-tracking`.

## Troubleshooting

#### Deploying my project takes a long time to finish.

We're aware of this fact, and this is mainly because of the [Amazon ElasticSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/). While other cloud infrastructure resources get deployed reasonably fast, this service can take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes to become ready.

Unfortunately, this is a well-known issue for quite some time, and until the present, there haven't been any positive improvements.

#### The AWS Access Key Id needs a subscription for the service

In some cases, upon deploying a new Webiny project, it's possible for users to experience the following error being thrown in their terminal:

```
SubscriptionRequiredException: The AWS Access Key Id needs a subscription for the service
```

This error can happen if an AWS account was just created. If that's the case, then there needs to pass some time until the account is fully activated on the AWS side. So, the only thing that can be done at this point is simply waiting and trying again later.

#### Newer Apple M1 devices

If you're using a next-generation Apple M1 device, there is a chance you might run into problems while deploying your new Webiny project. For example:

```
 +  pulumi:pulumi:Stack api-dev creating assertion failed [inst.has_value()]: failed to decode instruction: 0x0
```

This is probably due to the fact that the underlying software simply isn't ready yet for the new M1-based OS you're running. Based on [this](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27350) article, we've seen that doing the following export does resolve the shown issue in some cases:

```
export GODEBUG=asyncpreemptoff=1
```

Please try executing the command in your terminal, and run the deployment again. If this does not help, feel free to [ask](https://www.webiny.com/slack) for additional help.

#### Pulumi is throwing a `syscall.loadsystemlibrary` exception
There could be various reasons why this error was thrown. But, if deploying from a Windows machine, we've seen that it could be
caused by an anti-virus software that you might have installed on your machine. Our suggestion is to try to temporary disable it and see if that produces any positive outcome.
