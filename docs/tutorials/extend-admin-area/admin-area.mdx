:::tip WHAT YOU’LL LEARN
- how to quickly create a functional app Admin area app
:::


## Prerequisites
Before you start this tutorial, make sure that you have Webiny installed and read our [Introduction](/docs/tutorials/create-an-application/introduction) tutorial.

## Overview
The UI scaffold is our boilerplate React application that works out of the box without you needing to write any code.
It will enable you to create, update and delete the data via the form and to list and view it.
In this article, we will go through the process of generating the code.

The command you will run is `yarn webiny scaffold`, and you run it from the project root.

You will get a set of simple questions to answer and, in the end, a React application package will be generated.

Also, note that in this tutorial we will use `CarManufacturer` as our data model name.

## Running the Scaffold
Run the scaffold command and follow the questions. Select the `Admin Area package` option and let's go through all the questions in detail:

##### 1. Enter the name of the initial data model
This is the name of your API data model, so type it in.
As mentioned before, we will use `CarManufacturer` in this tutorial.

The GraphQL queries, mutations, responses, and variable names in the code will use this value in singular and plural, kebab-case, camel-case, or some other form.

```typescript
export const LIST_CAR_MANUFACTURERS = gql`
    query ListCarManufacturers(
        $sort: [CarManufacturerListSort!]
        $where: CarManufacturerListWhereInput
        $limit: Int
        $after: String
    ) {
        carManufacturers {
            listCarManufacturers(sort: $sort, where: $where, limit: $limit, after: $after) {
                data {
                    id
                    title
                    description
                    isNice
                    createdOn
                    savedOn
                    createdBy {
                        id
                        displayName
                        type
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
`;

export const CREATE_CAR_MANUFACTURER = gql`
    mutation CreateCarManufacturer($data: CarManufacturerCreateInput!) {
        carManufacturers {
            createCarManufacturer(data: $data) {
                data {
                    id
                    title
                    description
                    isNice
                    createdOn
                    savedOn
                    createdBy {
                        id
                        displayName
                        type
                    }
                }
                error {
                    code
                    message
                    data
                }
            }
        }
    }
`;
```

The name value is also used to create both the defaults for the package location and the package name.

The initial data model has 3 fields (`title`, `description` and `isNice`) to show you how to structure your data model.

Validation of the data model name allows only **a-z** and **A-Z**.
You can name your model all lowercase or all uppercase. It is up to you - but try to keep it in pascal-case.

##### 2. Enter the package location
A full location of the package, where the package files will be generated, from the root of the project.
:::info
The value given in the previous question is used to create the default package location.
:::

We think it is best to organize your packages in `packages` directory, so by default it is set into that directory, but you can type whatever location you want.
:::note
To learn more about Webiny's project organization, checkout [this](/docs/key-topics/project-organization/project-applications-and-packages) article.
:::

The default value is `packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app`. Notice that the data model name `CarManufacturer` is in plural and kebab-cased.

##### 3. Enter the package name
The package name that you will reference to in the code.
:::info
As in the location step, the value from the first question is used to create the default package name.
:::

The default value is `@car-manufacturers/admin-app` as we like scoping packages. You can set it to whatever you want, providing it is passing the validation.

## The Code
Generated code contains:
1. `src/views/graphql.ts` with GraphQL queries and mutations for the data model.
2. `src/views/CarManufacturers.tsx` with a React component that renders both the list view and the form.
3. `src/views/CarManufacturersDataList.tsx` with a React component that lists existing data models via the GraphQL queries.
4. `src/views/CarManufacturerForm.tsx` which utilizes our `@webiny/form` package to display and populate the form.
5. `src/rotues.tsx` with `RoutePlugin` definition to add the route in the admin area.
6. `src/menus.tsx` with `AdminMenuPlugin` definition to display the menu in the admin area.
7. `src/types.ts` with interfaces for entry items and data list props.
8. `src/index.ts` with exports of the plugins to be used in the admin app.

## Using the Generated Code in Your Project
In the main admin app file, you need to import your package and include it in the plugin registration array.
```typescript title="apps/admin/code/src/plugins/index.ts"
// at the top of the file
import carManufacturerPlugin from "@car-manufacturers/admin-app";

// in the end of the registration array
carManufacturerPlugin()
```

## Changing the Form
Let's say you want to add a new field named `country` to identify where is the Car manufacturer located.

You would add a new Cell component with Bind and Input components to the existing form, something like this:
```tsx title="packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app/src/views/CarManufacturerForm.tsx"
<Cell span={12}>
    <Bind name="country">
        <Input label={"Country"} />
    </Bind>
</Cell>
```

You need to change GraphQL as well, for example, we will add it into mutation for creating the entry:

```typescript title="packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app/src/views/graphql.ts"
export const CREATE_CAR_MANUFACTURER = gql`
    mutation CreateCarManufacturer($data: CarManufacturerCreateInput!) {
        carManufacturers {
            createCarManufacturer(data: $data) {
                data {
                    id
                    title
                    description
                    isNice
					# add new field here
					country
					#
                    createdOn
                    savedOn
                    createdBy {
                        id
                        displayName
                        type
                    }
                }
                error {
                    code
                    message
                    data
                }
            }
        }
    }
`;
```

You need to make changes in other mutations and queries as well.

## Changing the List

After you have the `country` field, you want to be able to sort by it. You would add it to the sorters in the data list component:
```tsx title="packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app/src/views/CarManufacturersDataList.tsx"
const sorters = [
    {
        label: "Newest to oldest",
        value: "createdOn_DESC"
    },
    {
        label: "Oldest to newest",
        value: "createdOn_ASC"
    },
    {
        label: "Tile A-Z",
        value: "title_ASC"
    },
    {
        label: "Title Z-A",
        value: "title_DESC"
    },
    // add sorters here
    {
        label: "Country A-Z",
        value: "country_ASC"
    },
    {
        label: "Country Z-A",
        value: "country_DESC"
    }
];
```

## Adding the Menu

If you want to add some new menu in the Admin area, check out the `packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app/src/menus.tsx` file.
You can make a copy of that file, name it `myMenu.tsx` and import it into the `packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app/src/index.ts`.

## Adding the Route

If you want your created menu to load some route, check out the `packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app/src/routes.tsx` file.
Also, you can copy that file and change what you require. Remember to import it into the `index.ts` file.

## Building the Code
When you make changes to the code, make sure you run `yarn webiny ws run build --folder=packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app` to compile your code for the deployment.

You can even have a watcher running for your code with `yarn webiny ws run watch --folder=packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app`.

Of course, the `folder` value is your package location.

## Run locally
Unlike the API, you can run the React application locally:
1. `cd apps/admin/code`
2. `yarn start --env=YOUR_ENVIRONMENT`

This will start the local build of the Admin app. Also, it will automatically rebuild and refresh when it detects changes in the code.


## Deploy the Admin App
To use the generated React application online, you must deploy it. To deploy, use the command:
```
yarn webiny deploy apps/admin --env YOUR_ENVIRONMENT
```

## Next Step...
Now you have the functional UI in the admin area to create, update, delete, and list the CarManufacturers.
