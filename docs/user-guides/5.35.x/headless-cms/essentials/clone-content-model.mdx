- how to clone a content model

</Alert>

Webiny allows you to create a new content model by cloning an existing content model. All the fields, validations, and other settings are copied over from the original content model to the clone content model.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to clone a content model. As an example, we will create a content model with the following attributes by cloning an existing content model:

| Attribute   | Value                                                         |
| :-------    | :----------------------                                       |
| Name        | **Virtual Product**                                           |
| Group       | **E-Commerce**                                                |
