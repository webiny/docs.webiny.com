Content model groups help in organizing content models. With groups, you can organize your models efficiently.
For example, all the content models related to E-Commerce can be grouped together,
and they will be shown in the side navigation bar under the E-Commerce heading. There are two main uses of
the content model group.

- Organization of content models
- Restrict the content models access scope based on the content model group

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a content model group.
As an example, we will create a E-Commerce content group with the following values:

| Attribute   | Value                  |

| Name        | E-Commerce             |
| Group icon  | üõí                     |
| Description | E-Commerce Model Group |
