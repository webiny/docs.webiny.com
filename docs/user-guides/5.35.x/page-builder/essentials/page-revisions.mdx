In Webiny, each modification made in a page (in the Page Builder) that is published is stored as a separate revision. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create multiple revisions of a page and publish a specific revision. We will also learn how to create a new page version from a previous revision.

We will do this in 4 steps:

- Step 1: Create a new page
- Step 2: Make multiple revisions of a page
- Step 3: Publish a specific revision of a page
- Step 4: Create a new page version from a previous revision

## Step 1: Create a New Page

If you are not familiar with how to create a page, please follow the [Create Page](/docs/{version}/user-guides/page-builder/essentials/create-page) tutorial.

1. From the **Side Menu**, click **Page Builder** > **PAGES** > **Pages**.

    ✔️ The **Pages** screen opens.

2. Add a new page in the **Static** category.

3. Update the title of the page to **Page Revisions**.

4. Add an empty block to the page.

5. Add a heading to the block and update its text to **Page Revisions**.

6. Update the margin-bottom of the heading to **60px**.

7. Add a paragraph below the heading and update its text to:
    
    **In Webiny, multiple revisions of a page can be made.**

8. Publish the page.


## Step 2: Make Multiple Revisions of a Page

1. On the **Pages** screen, click the **Page Revisions** list item in the list of pages.

    ✔️ The **PAGE PREVIEW** tab opens.

2. In the **PAGE PREVIEW** tab, click the **EDIT** icon (✏️).

    ✔️ The page editor screen opens.

3. Update the paragraph text to:

    **In Webiny, multiple revisions of a page can be made.**

    **A previous revision of a page can also be published.**

4. Click **PUBLISH CHANGES**.

    ✔️ The **Pages** screen opens with the message "Your page was published successfully!".

5. Now, following Steps 2 to 4, again update the paragraph text to:

    **In Webiny, multiple revisions of a page can be made.**

    **A previous revision of a page can also be published.**

    **And, a new version of a page can be made from a previous version.**

6. Publish the changes.

    ✔️ The **Pages** screen opens with the message "Your page was published successfully!".

2. Click the **REVISIONS** tab. 

    ✔️ The **PAGE PREVIEW** tab opens.

    **Note**: On the **REVISIONS** tab, all the page's revisions and their status are visible. A version can have one of the following status:

    - **Draft**: A version of page that is not published yet but can be edited and published.
    - **Published**: A version of page that is published and cannot be edited.
    - **Locked**: A version of page that has been published at least once and now cannot be edited but published. 
    
    A publsihed version is locked and remains locked after getting unpublished.

    ✔️ Menu opens with **New from current**, **Publish**, **Preview**, and **Delete Revision** options.

3. Click **New from current**.

5. Click **PUBLISH CHANGES**.

    ✔️ The **Pages** screen opens with the message "Your page was published successfully!".
