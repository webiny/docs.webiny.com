## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need a page in the Page Builder to import. If you don't have a page, please follow the [Create Page](/docs/{version}/user-guides/page-builder/essentials/create-page) tutorial to create it.

## Step 1: Export a Page

In this step, we will export the **The benefits of a Serverless CMS** page we created in the [Create Page](/docs/{version}/user-guides/page-builder/essentials/create-page) tutorial.

1. From the **Side Menu**, click **Page Builder** > **PAGES** > **Pages**.

   ✔️ The **Pages** screen opens.

2. Select the checkbox on the **The benefits of a Serverless CMS** list item in the list of pages.

   **Note**: You can export more than one page at a time by selecting the checkboxes of the pages you want to export. If you want to export all the pages at once, don't select any checkbox.

3. Click the **EXPORT** icon.

   ✔️ The **Select Page Revision** screen opens.

4. Select revision:

   | If                                                                                    | Then                |
   | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------ |

5. Click **CONTINUE**.

   ✔️ A screen appears with the prompt **Your export is now ready!**

6. Click the **COPY** icon to copy the export URL.

   (Or click **DOWNLOAD** to download the ZIP archive.)

7. Click **CLOSE**.

## Step 2: Import a Page

In this step, we will import the page we exported in Step 1. For this, you need to open the locale or instance in which you want to import the page.

1. From the **Side Menu**, click **Page Builder** > **PAGES** > **Pages**.

   ✔️ The **Pages** screen opens.

2. Click the **IMPORT** icon.

   ✔️ The **Select a category** screen opens.

3. Click **Static**.

4. Click **PASTE FILE URL** to import the page with the copied URL.

   (Or click **UPLOAD FILE** to import the page with the downloaded ZIP archive.)

5. Paste the copied URL in the **File URL** textbox and click **CONTINUE**.

   (Or upload the downloaded ZIP archive.)

   ✔️ The **Import Pages** screen appears with the message "All pages have been imported".
