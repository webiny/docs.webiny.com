    | :-------    | :----------------------                                              |

    | :-------             | :----------------------                     |
    | Name                 | **Blog**                                    |
    | Singular API Name    | **Blog**                                    |
    | Plural API Name      | **Blogs**                                   |
    | Content model group  | **Content**                                 |

    | Description          | **Blogs to be published in the application**|

3. Add the following fields with the given attributes to the **Blog** content model:

    | Field     | Label     | Field ID |

    | TEXT      | **Title** | title    |
    | TEXT      | **Slug**  | slug     |
    | RICH TEXT | **Body**  | body     |


## Step 2: Create a Publishing Workflow

1. From the **Side Menu**, click **Publishing Workflows** > **Workflows**.

    ‚úîÔ∏è The **Publishing Workflows** screen opens.

2. In front of **Headless CMS**, click **+ NEW WORKFLOW**.

    ‚úîÔ∏è **Untitled** form opens.

3. To rename the workflow, click the workflows's title **Untitled**.

    ‚úîÔ∏è A textbox appears.

4. In the textbox, update the text to **Blog Publishing Workflow**.

5. Click anywhere outside the textbox.


## Step 3: Define the Workflow

1. Inside the **Workflow steps** accordion, under **Step 1**, in the **Title** textbox, type **SEO Review**

2. In the **Type** dropdown, click **Mandatory, non-blocking**.

    **Note**: There are three options in the **Type** dropdown:

    - **Mandatory, blocking**: The review process cannot proceed until this step is completed. It serves as a mandatory and blocking phase.
    - **Mandatory, non-blocking**: Other steps are unlocked in the review process, but item publication awaits completion of all mandatory, non-blocking steps.
    - **Optional**: This step doesn't impede the review process, and the item can be published regardless of sign off. Choose this for steps that are supplementary or non-essential to the overall workflow. 
    

3. In the **Reviewers** section, select the **Adam Reviewer** checkbox.

    **Note**: You can add more steps to your workflow as per your requirements by clicking **+ ADD STEP** and following the Steps 1 to 3.

4. Click the **Scope** accordion.
