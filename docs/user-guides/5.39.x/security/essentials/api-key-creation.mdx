- how to create an API key

</Alert>

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create an API key with custom access permission to the Headless CMS. We will do this in 2 steps:

- Step 1: Create an API.
- Step 2: Define access permissions.

As an example, we will create an API with the following access permissions:

- Permission to view and update a specific content model group.
- Permission to view, create, update, and delete all content models inside the content model group.
- Permission to view, create, update, and delete the content entries inside the content models.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need to have a content model group named **E-commerce** in your Webiny instance. If you don't have it, please follow the [Create Content Model Group](/docs/{version}/user-guides/security/essentials/role-creation) tutorial to create it.
