In the Open Source version, you'll have basic roles and permissions, where users either have full access or no access to a particular application.  
To access the advanced roles and permissions feature, you need a Webiny Enterprise or Webiny Business license.

</Alert>

You can manage access permissions for users with Roles. In a Role, you define various access permissions, and then assign this Role to users.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a Role with custom access permission to the Headless CMS. We will do this in 2 steps:

- Step 1: Create a Role.
- Step 2: Define access permissions.

As an example, we will create a Role with the following access permissions:

- Permission to view and update a specific content model group.
- Permission to view, create, and update all content models inside the content model group.
- Permission to view, create, and update the content entries inside the content models.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need to have a content model group named **E-commerce** in your Webiny instance. If you don't have it, please follow the [Create Content Model Group](/docs/{version}/user-guides/security/essentials/Role-creation) tutorial to create it.
