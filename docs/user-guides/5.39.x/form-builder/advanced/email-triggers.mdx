- how to use the Submission and Thankyou email triggers in Form Builder

</Alert>

Two new options are now available under Webiny's Form Builder triggers - **E-mail - Submission Notification** and **E-mail - Thank You E-mail**. The “E-mail - Submission Notification” trigger sends an email every time a form submission is received. This feature facilitates staying updated when someone submits one of your forms. The “E-mail - Thank You E-mail” trigger sends an email to the user who submitted the form. In this tutorial, we will learn how to set up the Submission and Thankyou email triggers in Form Builder. We will do this in 2 steps:

- Step 1: Setting up E-mail - Submission Notification Trigger
- Step 2: Setting up E-mail - Thank You E-mail Trigger

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial you need to have the form **Registration Form** in your Webiny instance. If you don't have it, please follow the [Create Form](/docs/{version}/user-guides/form-builder/advanced/multi-steps-form) tutorial to create it.
