:::tip What you'll learn

- what are lifecycle events
- how lifecycle events work
- how to subscribe to a lifecycle event

:::

:::info
Lifecycle events using publish/subscribe pattern replace the hook plugins starting from version 5.18.0.
:::

## Overview

In our Headless CMS we provide lifecycle events available for you to hook into.

With the lifecycle events you can hook into a number of different operations.

For example, when using [DynamoDB + Elasticsearch](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/api-headless-cms-ddb-es/src/index.ts#L111) as storage layer, we use the `onBeforeSystemInstall` to insert the template for Elasticsearch index.

## System
### onBeforeSystemInstall
This event is triggered before the installation of the Headless CMS and insertion of initial "Ungrouped" group.
#### Event arguments

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| tenant | ID of the current tenant |

#### How to subscribe to this event?

```typescript
new ContextPlugin<CmsContext>(async context => {
    /**
     * There is no context.cms on options request, so we skip adding lifecycle event subscription.
     */
    if (!context.cms) {
        return;
    }
    context.cms.onBeforeInstall.subscribe(async({tenant}) => {
		await notifyAnotherSystemThatHeadlessCmsIsGettingInstalled({tenant});
    });
})
```
### onAfterSystemInstall
This event is triggered after the installation of the Headless CMS.
#### Event arguments

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| tenant | ID of the current tenant |

#### How to subscribe to this event?

```typescript
new ContextPlugin<CmsContext>(async context => {
    /**
     * There is no context.cms on options request, so we skip adding lifecycle event subscription.
     */
    if (!context.cms) {
        return;
    }
    context.cms.onAfterInstall.subscribe(async({tenant}) => {
		await notifyAnotherSystemThatHeadlessCmsWasInstalled({tenant});
    });
})
```

:::info
Please note that in between `onBeforeInstall` and `onAfterInstall` we create a default CmsGroup named "Ungrouped" and, because of that, there are events `onBeforeGroupCreate` and `onAfterGroupCreate` being run.
:::

## Entry

:::info
Note that `storageEntry`, `originalStorageEntry`, `latestStorageEntry` and `publishedStorageEntry` are objects derived from the `entry` object which we want to store into the database.
Those new objects have `StorageTransformPlugin` run on them to prepare them to be stored. To find out why we use `StorageTransformPlugin`, read about it in this [article](/docs/serverless-cms/headless-cms/plugins/storage-transform-plugin).

## Registering Lifecycle Event Subscriptions

### System Lifecycle Events
For the subscriptions (your code) to be run, you must register it in the `createHandler` in the `api/code/graphql/src/index.ts` file.

```typescript title="api/code/graphql/src/index.ts"

const handler = createHandler({
	plugins: [
        // ... rest of plugins
		new ContextPlugin<PbContext>(async context => {
		    /**
		     * There is no context.cms on options request, so we skip adding lifecycle event subscription.
		     */
		    if (!context.cms) {
		        return;
		    }
            context.cms.onBeforeInstall.subscribe(async({system}) => {
                // do your magic here
            });
		})
	],
});

```

### Group, Model And Entries Lifecycle Events
For the subscriptions (your code) to be run, you must register it in the `createHandler` in the `api/code/headlessCMS/src/index.ts` file.

```typescript title="api/code/headlessCMS/src/index.ts"

const handler = createHandler({
	plugins: [
        // ... rest of plugins
		new ContextPlugin<PbContext>(async context => {
		    /**
		     * There is no context.cms on options request, so we skip adding lifecycle event subscription.
		     */
		    if (!context.cms) {
		        return;
		    }
            context.cms.onBeforeEntryCreate.subscribe(async({entry}) => {
                // do your magic here
            });
		})
	],
});

```

:::warning
Please, be aware that the order of subscribing matters, so if you want some event subscription to be executed before some other one, add it first.
:::


:::note
The check condition for `context.cms` will not be required starting with version 5.22.0.
