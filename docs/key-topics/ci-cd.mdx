This article contains a more general information on what CI/CD is and its main phases. For more practical information and tips on how to set up a CI/CD workflow for your Webiny project, visit the [CI/CD How-To Guide](/docs/how-to-guides/ci-cd/introduction).

## What is CI/CD?

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI it is typically implied.

**Continuous deployment (CD)** is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production.

Note that the **CD** abbreviation can also stand for **continuous delivery**, which also entails continuous deployment of your project, only in a [more manual fashion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery):

> Continuous delivery is the ability to deliver software that can be deployed at any time through manual releases; this is in contrast to continuous deployment which uses automated deployments.

:::info
In the rest of this guide, when mentioning the **CI** abbreviation, we're explicitly referring to the **continuous deployment**.

## The Workflow

In general, the CI/CD workflow consists of a couple of phases:

<!-- vale on -->

It all starts with the **planing** phase, in which we define the work that needs to be done, and delegate it to different members of the team. Teams use different approaches in order to organize the team and track its progress, for example [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29) or [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban).

Once the work has been delegated, every developer goes through **code**, **build**, and **test** phases. Different tools, processes and services can be used here, starting from services for code storage and [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) like [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F) and [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub), different testing frameworks like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) or [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), build tools like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and so on.

:::info
Most of the mentioned tools are specific to the JavaScript / Node.js ecosystem, and come set up by default in every Webiny project. A full list of used technologies can be found in the [Technologies Used](/docs/key-topics/technologies) topic.
:::

Once the tests are passing, we reach the **release** and **deploy** phases, in which new changes are deployed to actual users. Again, a plethora of different deployment tools can be used in this space, like [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/), [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/), and so on. With the tools, there are also different deployment strategies that can be utilized, like blue/green and canary deployments, A/B testing, and so on.

:::info
By default, Webiny projects are deployed with Pulumi - a modern infrastructure as code (IaC) solution. Check out the [Iac with Pulumi](/docs/key-topics/deployment/iac-with-pulumi) topic to learn more.
:::

Last but certainly not the least, we reach the **operate** and **monitor** phases in which we are, essentially, ensuring that the system that was deployed is operating as expected. Different speed and resource metrics, error reports and alerts are what provide the information on how stable our system is.

In general, monitoring severless applications has shown to be a bit harder than monitoring "traditional" applications, mainly because of their distributed nature. They are almost always constructed out of several services that talk to each other and trying to find the service that is the root cause of a new issue can be hard. Fortunately, there are tools and services that assist us in this regard as well, for example [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) and [AWS X-ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/), [Lumigo](https://lumigo.io/), [Epsagon](https://epsagon.com/product/), and others.

And this completes the CI/CD workflow. Once we've passed through all of the steps, the whole workflow starts from the beginning, and it is repeating infinitely as part of our project development process. Note that the explained phases shouldn't be considered as a hard rule - certain phases can be implemented in different ways and adjusted to your needs. Be sure to check the [CI/CD How-To Guide](/docs/how-to-guides/ci-cd/introduction) for more practical information on how to set up a CI/CD workflow for your Webiny project.

## FAQ

#### Can I bring additional tools and services?

Yes, you can. All of the tools that come with every Webiny project are the tools we've determined to work good, but some can still be replaced, if need be.
