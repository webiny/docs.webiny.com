:::info
For brevity, the diagram doesn't include network-level cloud infrastructure resources, like region, VPC, availability zones, and so on. Check out the [Default VPC](/docs/key-topics/cloud-infrastructure/api/overview-vpc-default) and [Custom VPC](/docs/key-topics/cloud-infrastructure/api/overview-vpc-custom) topics if you're interested in that aspect of the deployed cloud infrastructure.

## Description

The diagram shows how HTTP requests (GraphQL queries and mutations) travel through the deployed cloud infrastructure. Request are primarily issued by the **Admin Area**, or **Website** applications, but of course, can be issued by other clients as well.

The steps are the following:

1. The GraphQL HTTP request first reaches the Amazon CloudFront <diagram-letter>A</diagram-letter>.
2. The request is forwarded to the Amazon API Gateway <diagram-letter>B</diagram-letter>.
3. The Amazon API Gateway invokes the GraphQL Server Lambda function <diagram-letter>C</diagram-letter>.
4. Depending on the issued GraphQL operation, the Lambda function's code may issue one or more requests to other cloud infrastructure resources:
    1. Amazon Cognito <diagram-letter>D</diagram-letter> to perform identity authentication
    2. Amazon DynamoDB <diagram-letter>E</diagram-letter> or Amazon ElasticSearch Service <diagram-letter>F</diagram-letter> to perform database queries
5. Once the code execution has completed, an HTTP response is returned back to the Amazon API Gateway <diagram-letter>B</diagram-letter>.
6. The Amazon API Gateway <diagram-letter>B</diagram-letter> forwards the request to the Amazon CloudFront <diagram-letter>A</diagram-letter>, which again forwards it back to the client.
