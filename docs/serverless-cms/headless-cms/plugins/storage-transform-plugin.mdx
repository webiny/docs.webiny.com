- when is it executed
- why do we need it

## Overview

The [StorageTransformPlugin](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/api-headless-cms/src/content/plugins/storage/StorageTransformPlugin.ts) serves as a transformer of field values, as it targets only certain field type.

## What Is It Used For?

The plugin is used to transform a certain field value to another value.
For example, the time in format `15:45:59` is not usable when filtering, so we transform it to seconds and store it as a number.

## When Is The Plugin Executed?

### Storing The Data
When storing the data (create, update and createFrom) the plugin's `toStorage` is executed just after the `onBefore` lifecycle events and before actual call to the storage operations.

	src={storingTheData}
/>

### Fetching The Data
When fetching the entries the plugin's `fromStorage` is executed in the GraphQL resolvers, just before the output of the field value. We decided to have it like this because of possible unnecessary calls to `fromStorage` if we executed it just after fetching the data from the database.

	src={fetchingTheData}
/>


#### Why Execute `fromStorage` Just Before The Output?
For example, let's imagine there is a entry field with a few megabytes of data in it - we stored it to S3 bucket.
It is ok to fetch the data and output it, if the field was requested via the GraphQL.
If the field was not requested, there is really no point in fetching remote data if it is not going to be used at all.


## Examples

### Time transform

If you have a `time` field type, the input value of that field is in form of `15:45:59`. That value is not comparable to another value when filtering in the database (or Elasticsearch in our case).

`StorageTransformPlugin` helps in this case by transforming the `15:45:59` into `56759`, which are the seconds of the day, before we store the value into the database.

Here is how the `time` transform plugin should look like:

```typescript
new StorageTransformPlugin({
    fieldType: "time",
    fromStorage: async ({ value }) => {
        const hours = Math.floor(value / 3600);
        const secondsAfterHours = value - (hours * 3600);
        const minutes = secondsAfterHours > 0 ? Math.floor(secondsAfterHours / 60) : 0;
        const seconds = secondsAfterHours - (minutes * 60);

        return [
            hours,
			minutes,
			seconds
        ].map(value => String(value).padStart(2, "0"))
		.join(":");


    },
    toStorage: async ({ value }) => {
        const [hours, minutes, seconds] = value.split(":").map(Number);

        return hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + seconds;
    }
});
```

### Text transform

If you have a `extremelyLargeText` field type, which can get really large (couple of megabytes). You might want to compress it or not store it into the database at all (DynamoDB for example, as it has 400 kilobytes record limit).

#### Compressing The Value
The `StorageTransformPlugin` helps in this case by compressing the field value.

Here is how `extremelyLargeText` transform plugin should look like:

```typescript
new StorageTransformPlugin({
    fieldType: "extremelyLargeText",
    fromStorage: async ({ value }) => {
        return decompress(value);
    },
    toStorage: async ({ value }) => {
        return compress(value);
    }
});
```

Of course, `compress` and `decompress` methods must be built as well. Or use some library for that.

#### Move To Other Storage System
If compression is not enough as the field value is extremely large, you can even move the value to some other storage system.

Here is an example for that:

```typescript
new StorageTransformPlugin({
    fieldType: "extremelyLargeText",
    fromStorage: async ({ value: identifier }) => {
        return await fetchFromOtherStorageSystem(identifier);
    },
    toStorage: async ({ value, field, model }) => {
        const identifier = `${model.modelId}-${field.fieldId}-${randomlyGeneratedString()}`
        await copyToOtherStorageSystem(identifier, value);
        return identifier;
    }
});
```

Of course, `copyToOtherStorageSystem` and `fetchFromOtherStorageSystem` are your own methods to copy and fetch the field value from other storage system.

## Registering The Plugin

For the plugin to take effect you must register it in the system. File to register it in is `api/code/headlessCMS/src/index.ts`.

Note that if you register two plugins for the same field type, system will use the last one.

```typescript title="api/code/headlessCMS/src/index.ts"
const handler = createHandler({
	plugins: [
        // ... other plugins
        new StorageTransformPlugin()
	]
});
```

## Conclusion

The `StorageTransformPlugin` makes it possible for you manage the value of the field, and where is it stored in case of storing to another storage system, so it is searchable.

:::warning
Be aware that in case of storing the value to other storage system, for example `extremelyLargeText`, you cannot search the value but only the identifier created when copying data to another storage system.
