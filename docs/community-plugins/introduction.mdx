:::

:::info Can I use this?

In order to follow this guide, you must use Webiny version **5.20.0** or greater.

:::

## Introduction

Community plugins are 3rd party supported plugins for Webiny. These plugins are created and managed by the Webiny community.
Here is the [repository](https://github.com/webiny-contrib/plugins) for community managed plugins.

## Contribute a New Plugin

### 1. Clone the Plugins Repository

All the community-supported 3rd party plugins are maintained at the [plugins repository](https://github.com/webiny-contrib/plugins).  
Clone the plugins repository in the Webiny project root.

`git clone https://github.com/webiny-contrib/plugins`

### 2. Create a React Component Package

We will use the React Component Package scaffold to create the plugin. From your project root, simply run the `yarn webiny scaffold` command:

```bash
yarn webiny scaffold
```

Then, from the list of all available scaffolds, select **React Component Package** and follow the on-screen instructions.

- Enter the name of the component (in pascal-case)  
  e.g. `IFrame`

- Enter the package location (packages/iframe)  
  Based on your plugin type, i.e. whether you are building a plugin for Page Builder or Headless CMS, select the respective directory, e.g. if you are creating an iframe plugin for Page Builder, the location will look something like this
  `plugins/pageBuilder/iframe`

- Enter the package name (@custom-components/iframe)  
  Please follow this pattern for package name `@webiny-contrib/name-of-your-plugin`  
  e.g. `@webiny-contrib/iframe`

### 3. Plugin Implementation

To implement your plugin, based on the plugin you want to create, please refer to the following tutorials:

- [Create a New Page Element for Page Builder](https://www.webiny.com/docs/tutorials/page-builder/create-a-new-page-element/)
- [Create a Custom Field Plugin for Headless CMS](https://www.webiny.com/docs/tutorials/headless-cms/create-a-webiny-headless-cms-custom-field-plugin)

:::info Important
Please place your code under the `src` directory e.g. `plugins/pageBuilder/iframe/src`.
:::

### 4. Raise the Pull Request

Once the plugin is ready, please create a pull request to [https://github.com/webiny-contrib/plugins](https://github.com/webiny-contrib/plugins) repository.
Webiny team will take care of publishing the community plugins to `npm` at [@webiny-contrib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webiny-contrib/).

## Contribute to Existing Plugins

You can find all the community managed plugins in [this repository](https://github.com/webiny-contrib/plugins), and every plugin has a contribution guide.  
Here is a process to set up and contribute to the [secretText Headless CMS plugin](https://github.com/webiny-contrib/plugins/tree/main/headlessCMS/secretText#how-to-contribute-to-this-plugin).
Please follow the respective contribution guide for contributing to the existing plugins.
