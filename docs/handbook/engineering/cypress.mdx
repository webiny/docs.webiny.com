## E2E Testing with Cypress

This section of our docs is dedicated to everything related to E2E testing of Webiny.

Basically, we load the smallest amount of records possible from the DynamoDB and then perform filtering and sorting in the code to lower the DynamoDB cost. Unfortunately, it might happen that we load all the records from a certain application, depending on the filtering applied, but generally that will not be the case.

## First Deployment

Once your new project has been created, itâ€™s time to deploy it into your AWS account.

To do that, in your terminal, navigate to your project folder, and run the following command:

```
yarn webiny deploy
```

By executing this command, all the project applications will first get built, and, along with needed cloud infrastructure resources, deployed into your AWS account.
