## Our Mission

**Building the digital content platform modern enterprises want, and developers deserve.**

Giving enterprises the means to take back control over their online experiences. 

## Our strategy

### Open-source as a foundation

We believe that open-source is the best way to build software. It allows us to build a better product, faster, and with the help of the community. It also allows us to build a product that is more secure, and more reliable.

Open-source for us doesn't just mean a permissive license, but also a transparent development process. We want to build a product that is developed in the open, and that's why we're building Webiny in public.

By rooting our values around open source we give the developers back that sense of freedom to customize and use the product the way they want.


### Developer experience as a priority

We believe that developer experience is the most important aspect of any software product. We want to build a product that developers love to use, and that's why we're building Webiny with developers in mind.

It's one thing to have an open-source license, and another thing actually architecting your product with open-source values in mind. Integration, customization and interoperability are all dependent on having a great developer experience. 

When we build any new feature at Webiny, we don't think about the feature as just a thing that needs to do a specific task, instead, we put great effort into also thinking about how someone might want to change the default behavior and build customizations on top of it, and then we build the required API so all of that becomes possible.

### Rooted in the first principles

Performance, security and reliability. These are the core principles we stand to uphold today and in the future. 

It might sound obvious, but we're hearing every day from users how many of the leading solutions in the market are not meeting this basic bar of what is crucial for them to have a good experience. 

### Data ownership as a right

Saying we care about customer's data, and doing something about it are very different things. 

We differentiate by understanding the value of customer's data. SaaS vendors put the same value on the data across all their customers. In their view, there is no difference if a customer uses their solution to keep track of how many socks they have in their warehouse, vs a customer using their solution to store patients' medical information.

We believe there's a big difference between the two and that our customers are the ones who are best equipped to manage their data most responsibly. One can only care for their own with the detail and precision that it requires.
