Because we primarily work with larger organizations, their needs for reliability and security are very high. The impact of a downtime or security breach comes to them at a much higher cost. We are aware of this and have taken measures to ensure the quality of our product.

## Satisfying our customers' expectations

It's not enough to say "Our product is of high quality", without being able to demonstrate what that means. Quality is not a thing, it is a result of doing the right thing, the right way. And when it comes to what that means, to us it means knowing what our customers expect from us and delivering on that. It also means that the product meets high standards of reliability and security. It means the product works as expected, and it means it works all the time in a performant way. We talk about those as [our principles](/docs/handbook/company/why-webiny-exists#rooted-in-the-first-principles), we we adhere to them.

Let's take a deeper dive and see what this means in practice. 

Firstly, [we work very closely with our customers](/docs/handbook/company/deciding-what-features-to-build#customer-driven-roadmap) and this allows us to have a deep understanding of their needs for our product. We know exactly what new features to build and what existing features to improve.

We also don't focus on just big things, since we're pretty much chatting with our customers and their engineering teams daily, we see the small things, the irks that annoy them, but not enough to call it a bug or to raise a feature request. Well, we fix those things too for them.

When it comes to security, there is no compromise. We documented our security posture in a separate article [here](/docs/overview/features/security). You're never done with security, it's a continuous process, and we're constantly improving.
