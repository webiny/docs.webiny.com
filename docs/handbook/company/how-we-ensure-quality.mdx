Because we primarily work with larger organizations, their needs for reliability and security are very high. The impact of a downtime or security breach comes to them at a much higher cost. Any downtime or performance degradations can cost them thousands of dollars per minute. We are aware of these and have taken measures to ensure the quality of our product.

## Satisfying our customers' expectations

It's not enough to say "Our product is of high quality", without being able to demonstrate what that means. Quality is not a thing, it is a result of doing the right thing, the right way. And when it comes to what that means, to us it means knowing what our customers expect from us and delivering on that. It also means that the product meets high standards of reliability and security. It means the product works as expected, and it means it works all the time in a performant way. We talk about those as [our principles](/docs/handbook/company/why-webiny-exists#rooted-in-the-first-principles), we we adhere to them.

Let's take a deeper dive and see what this means in practice. 

Firstly, [we work very closely with our customers](/docs/handbook/company/deciding-what-features-to-build#customer-driven-roadmap) and this allows us to have a deep understanding of their needs for our product. We know exactly what new features to build and what existing features to improve. Our customers not only influence our roadmap but take an active role in helping us build the required features. 

We also don't focus on just big things. Because we're pretty much chatting with our customers and their engineering teams daily, we see the small things, the irks that annoy them, but not enough to call it a bug or to raise a feature request. Well, we fix those things too for them.

When it comes to security, there is no compromise. We documented our security posture in a separate article [here](/docs/overview/features/security). You're never done with security, it's a continuous process, and we're constantly improving.

## Reliability & Performance

Reliability can often be a challenge with self-hosted products. This is mainly because it's your internal team that needs to have a great understanding of the internals of the product to correctly size and configure the necessary infrastructure. Then there are the undetermined factors, such as peak traffic usage, often caused by flash crowds, attacks, etc. 

To ensure Webiny stays reliable at all times and that it accounts for all the above-mentioned factors we've taken several measures which are embedded at the core of our product. A big part of why we're able to achieve high levels of reliability and performance is the fact that we decided to build our platform on the foundation of serverless infrastructure. You can read in more detail about why we chose serverless, and the benefits we got from such a decision in the [Why We Choose Serverless Infrastructure](/docs/handbook/company/why-we-chose-serverless) article. 


## Security 

Security posture for us has 2 sides. One is the security of the infrastructure our product runs on, and the other is the security of the product itself, including the security features that allow our users to configure the product to their needs.

Infrastructure security is something we take very seriously. Many parts go into this, from how things are encrypted, to giving customers the ability to bring in their current security features, like private VPC's, Lambda authorizers, and more. If you're interested in learning more about this, please read our [Security](/docs/overview/features/security) article.

When it comes to the security features of the application itself. We tick the regular boxes like having the ability to bring your own IdP, the ability to customize both the authentication and the authorization workflows, and more. We also support features like roles, API keys, and the ability to manage users inside teams. 

We go further than that. We allow users to structure their content, be that headless CMS entries, Page Builder pages, or assets, into folders and then assign on a folder level who can access and which access levels they have across all the entries in that folder. Files inside our File Manager can be marked as "private", so even if you share a direct link with someone, they will not be able to access that file unless they are authorized to do that. 

Our security posture and features keep evolving as our users push the product further and share even more complex use-cases with us.
