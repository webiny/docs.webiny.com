## Breaking Changes❗

### Assigning Users To Multiple Teams - Property Renames

✍️

### Updated Node.js to the Version 20

We have updated the `Node.js` version, which runs the code which gets deployed, to `v20`.

Users should update their development machines and CI deployments to use `Node.js` `v20`.

`Node.js` `v22` is not supported as AWS Lambda runtime, so we did not go that far yet. As soon as AWS Lambda supports `Node.js` `v22`, we will update the runtime to that version, and users will get notified about it in the upgrade docs.

We have also updated the `engines` field in the `package.json` file to reflect this change.

```diff-json
+  "engines": {
+    "node": "~20.0.0"
+  }
```

### Updated Typescript to the Version 4.9.5

We have updated the `Typescript` version to `v4.9.5`.

We also removed the `typescript` package from the `package.json` `resolutions`, so we are not forcing all the packages to use the same version.

```diff-json
  "resolutions": {
    ....
-    "typescript": "4.7.4",
    ....
  }
```

If you notice any issues with your project because of that, feel free to add version `4.9.5` into the `resolutions` field in your `package.json` file.

```diff-json

<Alert type="warning" title="Check and Update Your Code">
  Users should check their code for the potential breaking changes and update their code
  accordingly.
</Alert>

Unfortunately, updating the Typescript to the `v5+` is a bit problematic because we need to change our build process. It will probably be done for Webiny `v5.42.0` release.

## Headless CMS

### Enhance Bulk Actions with Background Tasks ([#4112](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4112))

We are excited to introduce a new enhancement in the Headless CMS: bulk actions handled through background tasks. This update streamlines large-scale content management processes, improving efficiency and providing a smoother user experience.

<Image src={hcmsBulkActionBackgroundTasks} alt="Managing Entries With Bulk Actions Powered By Background Tasks" />

With this release, users can now perform the following bulk actions in the background, without needing to process them in-series on the client side:

- Publish entries
- Unpublish entries
- Move entries to a folder
- Move entries to the trash bin
- Restore entries from the trash bin
- Permanently delete entries

When a user selects all entries in the list, a new banner will appear, asking for confirmation to include all entries, including those that haven’t been loaded yet. The banner will also appear if the current folder contains child folders.

Upon confirmation, the bulk action is processed by a background task, bypassing the need for the client to handle it in-series.

At this stage, real-time status updates on background tasks are not supported. Users will need to manually refresh the page to see the current status of their tasks.

## Page Builder

### Prerendering Service - AWS Lambda Timeouts ([#4330](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4330))

While prerendering a page that was just published, the Prerendering Service, or, more specifically, the AWS Lambda function that's responsible for prerendering the page, would sometimes run into an AWS Lambda timeout, causing the prerendering process to fail.

<Alert>

  One of the examples where this issue would occur is when a page contained one or more YouTube embeds.

</Alert>

With this release, we've done a thorough investigation and identified the root cause of the issue. And although [the fix might not be ideal](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4330/files) at the code level, it *did* show a significant improvement in the prerendering process, as the AWS Lambda timeouts were no longer an issue. 

We'll be monitoring the situation closely, and if we see that the issue persists, we'll be revisiting the code to come up with a more robust solution.

<Alert>

  To learn more about the prerendering process Webiny's Page Builder app users to prerender published pages, check out the [Prerendering Pages](https://www.webiny.com/docs/architecture/website/prerendering-pages) article.

</Alert>

## Security

### Multiple Roles and Teams Assignments ([#4198](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3976))

Prior to this release, Webiny users would only be able to possess one role, and also be assigned to one team. With this release, both of these limitations have been removed, and users can now be assigned to multiple teams, and possess multiple roles.

<Image src={multiRolesTeams} alt="Assigning Users To Multiple Teams" />

<Alert type="info">

Note that the Teams feature is part of Webiny's enterprise offering. To learn more, please check out the [Teams](/docs/enterprise/aacl/teams) article.

</Alert>

### Programmatic Creation of Roles and Teams ([#4303](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4303))

With this release, we've added the ability to programmatically create roles and teams. This is especially useful when you need to create a large number of roles and teams, and you don't want to do it manually.

To learn more, head over to the new [Programmatically Create Roles and Teams](/docs/security/extensions/programmatically-create-roles-and-teams) article.

### Copy Security Permissions Object ([#4303](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4303))

In order to make programmatic creation of roles and defining its permissions a bit easier, in the Roles and API Keys forms, we've introduced the "Copy as JSON" button. This button allows you to copy the entire security permissions object as a JSON string, which you can then use in your code.

<Image src={copySecurityPermissions} alt="Copy Security Permissions" />

## Development

### Introducing The New Watch Command (Local AWS Lambda Development) ([#4185](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4185))

<Alert title="Beta Feature">

This is a beta feature, and we're looking for feedback from the community. If you encounter any issues, please [let us know](https://www.webiny.com/slack).

</Alert>

From the early days, in order to perform both backend and frontend development, Webiny users would use the [`webiny watch`](/docs/core-development-concepts/basics/watch-command) command. And while this command works fine when it comes to frontend development (Admin, public website), we've come to a conclusion that it's not the best solution for backend development.

One of the reasons is the fact that, whenever a backend code change is made, the code needs to redeployed to AWS Lambda, which can take anywhere from 5 seconds, up to a minute, and even more. This can be a real productivity killer, especially when you're working on a feature that requires a lot of backend changes. Another reason is the inability to properly debug the backend code, as the `webiny watch` command doesn't provide a way to debug the code running in AWS Lambda.

To address these issues, we've been experimenting with a new approach, which we like to call **Local AWS Lambda Development**, and which we're introducing in this release as a beta feature.

Essentially, this new feature allows you to run your AWS Lambda code locally, without the need to continuously deploy changes to AWS. This means that, whenever you make a change to your backend code, you can immediately see the results, without the need to wait for the code to be deployed to AWS Lambda. And not only that, you can also debug your code, as the code is running in your local environment.

To give this new feature a try, you can add the following feature flag in your `webiny.project.ts` file:

```diff-ts webiny.project.ts
// ...

export default {
    template: "@webiny/cwp-template-aws@5.41.00",
    name: "my-webiny-project",
    cli: {
        plugins: [
            // ...
        ]
    },
    appAliases: {
        // ...
    },
+   featureFlags: {
+       newWatchCommand: true
+   }
};
```

Once that's done, you'll need to deploy your **Core** and **API** project applications, which can be done by running the following command:

```bash
yarn webiny deploy core,api --env dev
```

Finally, after the deployment is finished, you can start the new watch command by running:

```bash
yarn webiny watch api --env dev
```

With all of these steps completed, you should be able to see the new watch command in action. To learn more, we've also created a new section in our existing [`watch command`](/docs/core-development-concepts/basics/watch-command) article, which explains how to use this new feature.

We hope you'll find this new feature useful, and we're looking forward to hearing your feedback!

<Alert type="info" title="Nice to know">

The initial inspiration for building this feature came from [Serverless Stack](https://github.com/sst/sst) and its [Live Lambda Development](https://docs.sst.dev/live-lambda-development) feature. Webiny's version of this feature is almost identical to the one provided by Serverless Stack, with a few minor differences.

## Enterprise

### Audit Logs - Now Working Properly With Multi-theme Setup ([#4318](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4318))

Because of an internal code issue, in Webiny projects that were using multiple themes, the Audit Logs module in Admin Area would break. This issue has now been fixed, and Audit Logs are now working properly in multi-theme setups.

<Alert type="info">

Note that the Audit Logs feature is part of Webiny's enterprise offering. To learn more, please check out the [Teams](/docs/enterprise/aacl/teams) article.

## Deployments

### Missing Permission In "Deploy Webiny Project" CloudFormation Template ([#4323](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4323))

In order to deploy a Webiny project in a more controlled and secure manner, users can utilize the **Deploy Webiny Project** AWS CloudFormation template. Via three IAM user groups, the template deploys necessary ([least-privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)) set of permissions into a specified AWS account, which also automatically get linked with a designated Amazon IAM user.

With this release, we've addressed a couple of issues related to missing or incorrectly set permissions in the **Deploy Webiny Project** AWS CloudFormation template. 


<Alert type={"info"}>

  Learn more about the **Deploy Webiny Project** AWS CloudFormation template in our [Configure AWS Credentials](/docs/infrastructure/aws/configure-aws-credentials#deploy-webiny-project-aws-cloud-formation-template) article.

</Alert>

### Updated Pulumi Package Versions ([#4323](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4323/commits/7ce12e66ec7ddd7580ed702617c31a5c49ac0175))

We've updated the minimum required versions of Pulumi packages. The updated versions are as follows:

1. [`@pulumi/aws`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pulumi/aws): bumped from `^6.48.0"` to `^6.55.0`
2. [`@pulumi/pulumi`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pulumi/pulumi): bumped from `^3.128.0"` to `^3.136.1`

As we can see, we've only bumped the patch versions of these packages, which means that there shouldn't be any breaking changes. However, as a best practice, we recommend that you test your deployments in a non-production environment before deploying to production.

<Alert type="info">

  Webiny projects are deployed with Pulumi - a modern infrastructure as code (IaC) solution. Check out the [Iac with Pulumi](/docs/infrastructure/pulumi-iac/iac-with-pulumi) topic to learn more.

### Elasticsearch and OpenSearch Shared Indexes ([#4306](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4306))

In this release we have added the ability to make Webiny share indexes via Pulumi configuration.

To find out more about shared indexes, please read [this](/docs/core-development-concepts/extending-and-customizing/how-to-customize-elasticsearch-index) article.


To make Elasticsearch share indexes, you need to add the following configuration to your `apps/core/webiny.aplication.ts` file:
```diff-ts
import { createCoreApp } from "@webiny/serverless-cms-aws";

export default createCoreApp({
    pulumiResourceNamePrefix: "wby-",
    openSearch: {
+        sharedIndexes: true
    }
});
```

And to the `apps/api/webiny.application.ts` file:
```diff-ts
import { createApiApp } from "@webiny/serverless-cms-aws";

export default createApiApp({
    pulumiResourceNamePrefix: "wby-",
    openSearch: {
+        sharedIndexes: true
    }
});
```

To make Elasticsearch share indexes, you need to add the following configuration to your `apps/core/webiny.aplication.ts` file:
```diff-ts
import { createCoreApp } from "@webiny/serverless-cms-aws";

export default createCoreApp({
    pulumiResourceNamePrefix: "wby-",
    elasticSearch: {
+        sharedIndexes: true
    }
});
```

And to the `apps/api/webiny.application.ts` file:
```diff-ts
import { createApiApp } from "@webiny/serverless-cms-aws";

export default createApiApp({
    pulumiResourceNamePrefix: "wby-",
    elasticSearch: {
+        sharedIndexes: true
    }
});
```

<Alert type="danger">

  You should `NOT` change the `sharedIndexes` configuration after the initial deployment. If you do, you will lose all the data.

## Other Improvements

### Introduced `robots.txt` For Admin and Website Apps ([#4329](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4329))

For both Admin and Website apps, we've introduced the `robots.txt` file, which is now available in the following locations:

1. `apps/admin/public/robots.txt`
2. `apps/website/public/robots.txt`

The `robots.txt` file is used to provide instructions to web robots (also known as web crawlers) about the pages that should be crawled or not crawled. By default, the `robots.txt` file is set to allow all web crawlers to crawl all pages for the Website app, and disallow all web crawlers from crawling all pages for the Admin app. In case of the Admin app, this is done to prevent search engines from indexing the Admin app pages.

For projects that are being upgraded from a previous version of Webiny, the `robots.txt` file will be automatically created during the upgrade process.


### A Background Task Step Function Is Now Triggered Via Direct AWS SDK call ([#4289](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4289))

Prior to this version, a background task Step Function was triggered via an Event Bridge event. This caused problems when a background task had child tasks - sometimes child task failed but the parent did not know about it.

Now we have a reference to the child task and the parent can check if the child task is actually running.

It also allowed us to trigger a Step Function with a name - for easier debugging and referencing.
