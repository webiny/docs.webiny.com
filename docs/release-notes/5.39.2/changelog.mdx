## Headless CMS

### Ability to Immediately Publish Entries When Using `createEntryRevisionFrom` Method ([#3894](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3894))

With the 5.39.0 release, we've improved the existing `create{MODEL_NAME}` GraphQL mutation that's used for creating new content entries. More specifically, we've introduced the ability to create and immediately publish a content entry. For example:

```graphql
mutation {
  createVideo(
    data: {
      status: "published"
      title: "Test"
      description: "Test description."
    }
  ) {
    data {
      id
      title
      description
    }
  }
}
```

With this release, we've added the same ability to the `createEntryRevisionFrom` mutation, which is used for creating new revisions of existing content entries. For example:

```graphql
mutation {
  createVideoRevisionFrom(
    revision: "5f9e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e3e"
    data: {
      status: "published"
      title: "Test"
      description: "Test description."
    }
  ) {
    data {
      id
      title
      description
    }
  }
}
```

### Content Models Defined Via Code - Ability to Disable Authorization ([#3865](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3865))

### New `AccessCont for checking base permissions ([#3865](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3865))

### Addressing Invalid `TYPE` Field Value ([#3893](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3893))

We've addressed an issue where, for one or more CMS content entries, their internal `TYPE` field value was not being set correctly. Although this issue wasn't causing any problems while using Webiny, for some users that are using the [Amazon DynamoDB + Amazon ElasticSearch database setup](/docs/5.38.x/architecture/introduction#different-database-setups), it did cause an issue when running the 5.39.0 data migration. This issue has been resolved. 

#### Data Migrations

Note that, with this release, the new `5.39.2-001` data migration has been introduced, which fixes the `TYPE` field value for all existing content entries and again tries to perform [the meta fields data migration](/docs/release-notes/5.39.0/date-time-and-identity-meta-fields#data-migration) on entries that weren't migrated with the initial `5.39.0-001` data migration included with the 5.39.0 release.
