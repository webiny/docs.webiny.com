### Addressing Invalid `TYPE` Field Value ([#3893](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3893))

We've addressed an issue where, for one or more CMS content entries, their internal `TYPE` field value was not being set correctly. Although this issue wasn't causing any problems while using Webiny, for some users that are using the [Amazon DynamoDB + Amazon ElasticSearch database setup](/docs/5.38.x/architecture/introduction#different-database-setups), it did cause an issue when running the 5.39.0 data migration. This issue has been resolved. 

#### Data Migrations

Note that, with this release, the new `5.39.2-001` data migration has been introduced, which fixes the `TYPE` field value for all existing entries and again tries to perform [the meta fields data migration](/docs/release-notes/5.39.0/date-time-and-identity-meta-fields#data-migration) on entries that weren't migrated with the initial data migration included with the 5.39.0 release.

### FLP - Ensure Permissions Are Correctly Propagated To Nested Folders ([#3890](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3890))

### FLP - Prioritize Full Access Permissions Over Custom Ones ([#3889](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3889))
