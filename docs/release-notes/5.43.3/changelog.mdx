## Headless CMS

### Fix nested search in the Elasticsearch/OpenSearch systems. ([#4665](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4665))

...

### Check security authorization while decorating CMS methods ([#4667](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4667))
The FLP (Field Level Permissions) decoration applied to CMS CRUD methods is now properly disabled when authorization is turned off â€” for example, when using `context.security.withoutAuthorization`. 

This ensures that method behavior aligns correctly with the current security context.
