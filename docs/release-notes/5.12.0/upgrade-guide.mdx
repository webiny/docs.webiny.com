## 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

Upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages by running the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.12.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.12.0`.

Before moving on, make sure you commit all your changes.

## 2. Run the Upgrade Command

The next step is to run the project upgrade:

```bash
yarn webiny upgrade 5.12.0
```

Once the upgrade command has finished, you can run the [`git status`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) command to see all changes that the command performed.

## 3. Deploy Your Project

Finally, proceed by redeploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```

<Alert type="warning">

As stated in the [Upgrade Webiny](/docs/release-notes/upgrade-webiny#pre-production-environments-first) section, we recommend that you first deploy your changes into one of your pre-production environments, like `dev` or `staging`.
