Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.23.0`.

The next step is to run the project upgrade:

yarn webiny upgrade
```

Proceed by re-deploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```
