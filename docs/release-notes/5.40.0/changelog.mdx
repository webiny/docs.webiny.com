## Breaking Changes❗

### Removed Deprecated APIs ([#4051](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4051))

With this release, we've removed a couple of backend JavaScript APIs that were marked as deprecated in previous releases. 

Essentially, we've removed a couple of older methods used for subscribing to lifecycle events and also for performing Headless CMS-related security permissions checks. 

For more information and how to migrate your code, please refer to the separate [Deprecated APIs](/docs/release-notes/5.40.0/deprecated-apis) article.

## Other Improvements

### Webiny CLI and `create-webiny-project` ([#4045](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4045))
