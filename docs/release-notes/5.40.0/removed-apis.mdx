## Overview

As mentioned in the [changelog](/docs/release-notes/5.40.0/changelog#removed-deprecated-ap-is-4051), with this release, we've removed a couple of frontend and backend JavaScript APIs that were marked as deprecated in previous releases.

In this guide, we'll go through the list of deprecated APIs and their replacements.

## Headless CMS

### Removed Methods Related to Checking Security Permissions (Performing Authorization)

We've removed a set of methods related to checking security permissions (performing authorization) that were accessible via the `context.cms.permissions` object. To provide more context, here's an example of how the object could've been used in a simple `CmsGraphQLSchemaPlugin` plugin:

```ts
import { CmsGraphQLSchemaPlugin } from "@webiny/api-headless-cms";
import { ErrorResponse, Response } from "@webiny/handler-graphql";

new CmsGraphQLSchemaPlugin<Context>({
  typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    extend type Query {
      myListVideos: VideosListResponse
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      myListVideos: async (_, __, context) => {
        // Ensure user can read entries.
        const hasAccess = await context.cms.permissions.entries.ensure({
          rwd: "r"
        });

        if (!hasAccess) {
          throw new ErrorResponse({
            message: "Unauthorized: Insufficient access rights."
          });
        }

        // ...
      }
    }
  }
});
```

In the example above, the `context.cms.permissions.entries.ensure` method is used to check if the current user has the required permissions to read entries.

With this release, the `context.cms.permissions` object has been removed. Instead, you should use the `context.cms.accessControl` object to perform the same checks.

<Alert type="info">

With this [5.39.2](/docs/release-notes/5.39.2/changelog#new-authorization-related-utilities-3865) release, weâ€™ve introduced a new property on the CMS context object, called `accessControl`. Essentially, this property is a reference to the [AccessControl](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/dev/packages/api-headless-cms/src/crud/AccessControl/AccessControl.ts) class instance, which is used to perform authorization checks on content model groups, models, and entries.

</Alert>

If we were to rewrite the previous example using the new `context.cms.accessControl` object, it would look like this:

```diff-ts
import { CmsGraphQLSchemaPlugin } from "@webiny/api-headless-cms";
import { ErrorResponse, Response } from "@webiny/handler-graphql";

new CmsGraphQLSchemaPlugin<Context>({
  typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    extend type Query {
      myListVideos: VideosListResponse
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      myListVideos: async (_, __, context) => {
        // Ensure user can read entries.
+       const model = await context.cms.getModel("myVideo");
+       const hasAccess = await context.cms.accessControl.canAccessEntry({
+         model,
+         rwd: "r"
+       });

        if (!hasAccess) {
          throw new ErrorResponse({
            message: "Unauthorized: Insufficient access rights."
          });
        }

        // ...
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Renamed `createCmsModel` and `createCmsGroup` Plugin Factory Functions

We've renamed the `createCmsModel` and `createCmsGroup` plugin factory functions to `createCmsModelPlugin` and `createCmsGroupPlugin`. By having a more explicit name of the function, we're making it more clear what the function actually does.

With the 5.40.0 release, the old functions will be still available, but do note that they will be removed in the upcoming quarterly (5.41.0) release.

## Page Builder

Multiple legacy methods used for subscribing to Page Builder application's lifecycle events have been removed.

### `AppPbWebsiteSettings` Replaced with `WebsiteSettingsConfig`

`AddPbWebsiteSettings` component to add website settings was replaced by `WebsiteSettingsConfig`. This was done to enable more features, and more control over the website settings view.

Until this release, you would use `AddPbWebsiteSettings` like this:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import gql from "graphql-tag";
import { AddPbWebsiteSettings } from "@webiny/app-serverless-cms";

const { Group, Element } = AddPbWebsiteSettings;

export const SocialNetworks = () => {
  const socialNetworks = gql`
    {
      network1
    }
  `;

  return (
    <Group name={"socialNetworks"} label={"Social Networks"} querySelection={socialNetworks}>
      <Element>{/* Your UI goes here */}</Element>
    </Group>
  );
};
```

If we were to rewrite the previous example using `WebsiteSettingsConfig`, it would look like this:

```diff-tsx
import React from "react";
import gql from "graphql-tag";
+ import { WebsiteSettingsConfig } from "@webiny/app-page-builder";

+ const { Group, Element } = WebsiteSettingsConfig;

+ const MyElement = () => {
+   return <>{/* Your UI goes here */}</>
+ }

export const SocialNetworks = () => {
  const socialNetworks = gql`
    {
      network1
    }
  `;

  return (
+   <WebsiteSettingsConfig>
      <Group name={"socialNetworks"} label={"Social Networks"} querySelection={socialNetworks}>
+       <Element name={"myElement"} element={<MyElement />} />
      </Group>
+   </WebsiteSettingsConfig>
   );
};
```

Notice how, besides the code itself, the import changed; the `WebsiteSettingsConfig` is now imported from `@webiny/app-page-builder`. With this new config, we recommend creating dedicated components for your elements. Usage of `children` prop is no longer supported.

## I18N

Multiple legacy methods used for subscribing to I18N application's lifecycle events have been removed.

### Locales

| Deprecated API         | Description                          | Replacement API        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `onBeforeLocaleCreate` | Triggered before a locale is created | `onLocaleBeforeCreate` |
| `onAfterLocaleCreate`  | Triggered after a locale is created  | `onLocaleAfterCreate`  |
| `onBeforeLocaleUpdate` | Triggered before a locale is updated | `onLocaleBeforeUpdate` |
| `onAfterLocaleUpdate`  | Triggered after a locale is updated  | `onLocaleAfterUpdate`  |
| `onBeforeLocaleDelete` | Triggered before a locale is deleted | `onLocaleBeforeDelete` |
| `onAfterLocaleDelete`  | Triggered after a locale is deleted  | `onLocaleAfterDelete`  |

### Installation

| Deprecated API    | Description                                | Replacement API         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `onBeforeInstall` | Triggered before Page Builder is installed | `onSystemBeforeInstall` |
| `onAfterInstall`  | Triggered after Page Builder is installed  | `onSystemAfterInstall`  |

## File Manager

### Removed `FileManagerFileTypePlugin` Class

We've removed the `FileManagerFileTypePlugin` class, which was used to define custom file types in File Manager. More specifically, the class enabled developers to introduce custom file preview and custom file actions for all files of a specific type.

With this release, instead of using the `FileManagerFileTypePlugin` class, developers are encouraged to implement custom file preview and custom file actions using the new React components, both of which is covered in the following guides:

- [Custom File Preview](/docs/file-manager/extending/customize-file-preview)
- [Custom File Actions](/docs/file-manager/extending/customize-file-actions)

## Forms

### Removed the `form` Object from `Bind` component and `useBind` Hook

A reference to `form` was removed from the `<Bind>` component render prop, and `useBind` hook. You should now use the `useForm` hook to get a reference to the parent Form object. This was done to optimize re-rendering, and also make a clear separation between the form itself, and bindings to the UI.

Until this release, you could get a reference to the `form` instance from Bind's render prop, like this:

```tsx Pre 5.40.
import { Form, Bind } from "@webiny/form";

const MyView = () => {
  return (
    <Form>
      {() => (
        <Bind name="value" defaultValue={""}>
          {({ value, onChange, form }) => (
            /* Notice the `form` object in the render prop params. */
            <span>Your UI that does something with the `form`.</span>
          )}
        </Bind>
      )}
    </Form>
  );
};
```

From 5.40.0 on, you will have to write this differently. More often than not, you're adding new inputs to existing forms via plugins, so you're just mounting `<Bind>` elements, or use the `useBind` hook. To get access to the form object, you'll need to use the `useForm` hook, like this:

```tsx Post 5.40.
import { Form, Bind } from "@webiny/form";

const MyButton = () => {
  // You can now access the form via a hook.
  const form = useForm();

  const handleClick = () => {
    // Let's imagine you want to set some other field's value.
    form.setValue("someOtherField", 123);
  };

  return (
    <Bind name="value">
      {({ value, onChange }) => (
        // Notice the `form` object passed to the render prop function.
        <button onClick={handleClick}>Button</button>
      )}
    </Bind>
  );
};

// Let's imagine your component is mounted within some form in the Admin app.
const MyView = () => {
  return <Form>{() => <MyButton />}</Form>;
};
```
