## Overview

As mentioned in the [changelog](/docs/release-notes/5.40.0/changelog#removed-deprecated-ap-is-4051), with this release, we've removed a couple of frontend and backend JavaScript APIs that were marked as deprecated in previous releases.

In this guide, we'll go through the list of deprecated APIs and their replacements.

## Headless CMS

### Removed Methods Related to Checking Security Permissions (Performing Authorization)

We've removed a set of methods related to checking security permissions (pPerforming authorization) that were accessible via the `context.cms.permissions` object. To provide more context, here's an example of how the object could've been used in a simple `CmsGraphQLSchemaPlugin` plugin:

```ts
import { CmsGraphQLSchemaPlugin } from "@webiny/api-headless-cms";
import { ErrorResponse, Response } from "@webiny/handler-graphql";

new CmsGraphQLSchemaPlugin<Context>({
  typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    extend type Query {
      myListVideos: VideosListResponse
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      myListVideos: async (_, __, context) => {
        // Ensure user can read entries.
        const hasAccess = await context.cms.permissions.entries.ensure({
          rwd: "r"
        });

        if (!hasAccess) {
          throw new ErrorResponse({
            message: "Unauthorized: Insufficient access rights."
          });
        }

        // ...
      }
    }
  }
});
```

In the example above, the `context.cms.permissions.entries.ensure` method is used to check if the current user has the required permissions to read entries. 

With this release, the `context.cms.permissions` object has been removed. Instead, you should use the `context.cms.accessControl` object to perform the same checks.

<Alert type="info">

  With this [5.39.2](/docs/release-notes/5.39.2/changelog#new-authorization-related-utilities-3865) release, weâ€™ve introduced a new property on the CMS context object, called `accessControl`. Essentially, this property is a reference to the [AccessControl](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/dev/packages/api-headless-cms/src/crud/AccessControl/AccessControl.ts) class instance, which is used to perform authorization checks on content model groups, models, and entries.

</Alert>

If we were to rewrite the previous example using the new `context.cms.accessControl` object, it would look like this:

```diff-ts
import { CmsGraphQLSchemaPlugin } from "@webiny/api-headless-cms";
import { ErrorResponse, Response } from "@webiny/handler-graphql";

new CmsGraphQLSchemaPlugin<Context>({
  typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    extend type Query {
      myListVideos: VideosListResponse
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      myListVideos: async (_, __, context) => {
        // Ensure user can read entries.
+       const model = await context.cms.getModel("myVideo");
+       const hasAccess = await context.cms.accessControl.canAccessEntry({
+         model,
+         rwd: "r"
+       });

        if (!hasAccess) {
          throw new ErrorResponse({
            message: "Unauthorized: Insufficient access rights."
          });
        }

        // ...
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Renamed `createCmsModel` and `createCmsGroup` Plugin Factory Functions

We've renamed the `createCmsModel` and `createCmsGroup` plugin factory functions to `createCmsModelPlugin` and `createCmsGroupPlugin`. By having a more explicit name of the function, we're making it more clear what the function actually does.

With the 5.40.0 release, the old functions will be still available, but do note that they will be removed in the upcoming quarterly (5.41.0) release.

## Page Builder

Multiple legacy methods used for subscribing to Page Builder application's lifecycle events have been removed.

## File Manager

### Removed `FileManagerFileTypePlugin` Class

We've removed the `FileManagerFileTypePlugin` class, which was used to define custom file types in File Manager. More specifically, the class enabled developers to introduce custom file preview and custom file actions for all files of a specific type.

With this release, instead of using the `FileManagerFileTypePlugin` class, developers are encouraged to implement custom file preview and custom file actions using the new React components, both of which is covered in the following guides:

- [Custom File Preview](/docs/file-manager/extending/customize-file-preview)
- [Custom File Actions](/docs/file-manager/extending/customize-file-actions)
