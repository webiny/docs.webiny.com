## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

Upgrade all Webiny NPM packages by running the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.40.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return **5.40.0**.

### 2. Run the Upgrade Command

The next step is to run the project upgrade:

```bash
yarn webiny upgrade
```

### 3. Breaking Changes❗

#### 3.1 Removed Deprecated APIs

As mentioned in the [changelog](/docs/release-notes/5.40.0/changelog#removed-deprecated-ap-is-4051), with this release, we've removed a couple of backend JavaScript APIs that were marked as deprecated in previous releases.

Essentially, we've removed a couple of older methods used for subscribing to lifecycle events and also for performing Headless CMS-related security permissions checks.

Before deploying, please refer to the separate [Deprecated APIs](/docs/release-notes/5.40.0/deprecated-apis) article, and make sure to update your project code, if need be.

### 4. Deploy Your Project

Proceed by redeploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```
