## Headless CMS

### FLP - Improved Permissions Inheritance ([#4630](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4630))

✍️

### Use Heartbeat In Record Locking Mechanism ([#4583](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4583))

We refactored the record locking mechanism to use the heartbeat instead of React `useEffect` to unlock the record.
Record is unlocked by default after 30 seconds of the system not receiving a heartbeat signal.

## Deployments

### ✍️ Fixed Existing VPCs Not Used With OpenSearch ([#4532](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4532))

## Development

### TypeScript 5.3.3 ([#4464](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4464))

We have upgraded TypeScript to version `5.3.3`. At this point we cannot go any higher because of the `@rmwc/*` packages.

Also, `fastify` was updated to 4.29.0 - which might affect users which are hooking into the `fastify` handler. If something is wrong in your code, the TypeScript build will break, and it is an easy fix - just check the fastify [docs](https://fastify.dev/docs/v4.29.x/).

### Ensuring Same Webiny package Versions ([#4628](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4628))
