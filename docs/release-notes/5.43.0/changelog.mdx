## Headless CMS

### FLP - Improved Permissions Inheritance ([#4630](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4630))

✍️

### Use Heartbeat In Record Locking Mechanism ([#4583](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4583))

We refactored the record locking mechanism to use the heartbeat instead of React `useEffect` to unlock the record.
Record is unlocked by default after 30 seconds of the system not receiving a heartbeat signal.

## Deployments

### ✍️ Fixed Existing VPCs Not Used With OpenSearch ([#4532](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4532))

## Development

### TypeScript 5.3.3 ([#4464](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4464))

We have upgraded TypeScript to version `5.3.3`. At this point we cannot go any higher because of the `@rmwc/*` packages.

Also, `fastify` was updated to 4.29.0 - which might affect users which are hooking into the `fastify` handler. If something is wrong in your code, the TypeScript build will break, and it is an easy fix - just check the fastify [docs](https://fastify.dev/docs/v4.29.x/).

### Webiny Packages Versions ([#4628](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4628))

From now on, each time you run the Webiny CLI, it will check if all `@webiny/*` NPM packages in your project are using the same version. This is important because Webiny packages are tightly integrated, and having different versions can lead to unexpected issues.

The following screenshot shows an example of the CLI warning you about a version mismatch:

### Introducing the `webiny refresh` Command ([#4552](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4552))

Multiple times in the past, we've seen users needing to run the [`pulumi refresh`](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/cli/commands/pulumi_refresh/) command in order to refresh the state of their Pulumi stacks.

Up until now, to do this, users had to run the following command:

```bash
yarn webiny pulumi api --env dev -- refresh --yes
```

To make this process a bit more straightforward, instead of the above command, users can now simply run:

```bash
yarn webiny refresh api --env dev
```

Functionally, both commands do the same thing, but the new one is shorter and easier to remember.
