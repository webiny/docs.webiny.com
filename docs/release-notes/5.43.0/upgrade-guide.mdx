## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

Upgrade all Webiny NPM packages by running the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.43.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return **5.43.0**.

### 2. Run the Upgrade Command

The next step is to run the project upgrade:

```bash
yarn webiny upgrade
```

#### Amazon OpenSearch Service - VPC Configuration Issue ([#4532](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4532))

üìùüìùüìù

Prior to this release, when deploying a Webiny project with the [existing Amazon VPC](https://www.webiny.com/docs/enterprise/use-existing-amazon-vpc) configuration in place, the Amazon OpenSearch service that Webiny deploys would not get correctly attached to the specified Amazon VPC (related subnets and security groups).

For example, the following configuration would not work as expected. Contrary to the expectation, the deployed Amazon OpenSearch cluster would not be attached to the specified `OPENSEARCH_PRIVATE_SUBNETS` subnets and `OPENSEARCH_SECURITY_GROUPS` security groups:

```ts apps/core/webiny.application.ts
import { createCoreApp } from "@webiny/serverless-cms-aws/enterprise";

const OPENSEARCH_PRIVATE_SUBNETS = ["private-subnet-id-1", "private-subnet-id-2"];
const OPENSEARCH_SECURITY_GROUPS = ["security-group-id-1"];

const LAMBDA_FUNCTIONS_PRIVATE_SUBNETS = ["private-subnet-id-1", "private-subnet-id-2"];
const LAMBDA_FUNCTIONS_SECURITY_GROUPS = ["security-group-id-1"];

export default createCoreApp({
  pulumiResourceNamePrefix: "wby-",
  openSearch: true,
  vpc: {
    useExistingVpc: {
      elasticSearchDomainVpcConfig: {
        subnetIds: OPENSEARCH_PRIVATE_SUBNETS,
        securityGroupIds: OPENSEARCH_SECURITY_GROUPS
      },
      lambdaFunctionsVpcConfig: {
        subnetIds: LAMBDA_FUNCTIONS_PRIVATE_SUBNETS,
        securityGroupIds: LAMBDA_FUNCTIONS_SECURITY_GROUPS
      }
    }
  }
});
```

With this release, the underlying issue should no longer occur, and the above configuration will work as expected‚Äîwith one minor change: instead of using `elasticSearchDomainVpcConfig`, users should now use `opensearchDomainVpcConfig`.

For more information on this change and also how to upgrade your existing Webiny project, please refer to the [5.43.0 migration guide](/docs/release-notes/5.43.0/upgrade-guide) guide.

##### Breaking Change‚ùó

Because of the fact that, with this fix in place, the VPC configuration now gets correctly attached to the Amazon OpenSearch cluster, redeploying an existing Webiny instance will cause the cluster to be **DESTROYED AND RECREATED**Ô∏è, which means **all data in the existing cluster will be lost**‚ùó

Luckily, the data can be recreated via the [Elasticsearch Reindexing Task](https://www.webiny.com/docs/core-development-concepts/background-tasks/built-in-background-tasks#elasticsearch-reindexing-task).

For more information on how to migrate your existing Webiny project to the new VPC configuration and also how to safely reindex your data, please refer to the [5.43.0 migration guide](/docs/release-notes/5.43.0/upgrade-guide) guide.

### 4. Deploy Your Project

Proceed by redeploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```
