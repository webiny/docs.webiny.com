## Headless CMS

### Published Records Updated Correctly Upon Calling `createRevisionFrom`  ([#4180](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4180))

Prior to this release, when immediately publishing a revision created using the `createRevisionFrom` method, the revision's internal "published" record would not be updated correctly. This would cause the old published revisions to still be returned when performing queries. 

This issue has been fixed, and now the published record is updated correctly when calling the `createRevisionFrom` method.

## Other Improvements

### Webiny Telemetry Service (WTS) - Using NPM Package Instead of a GitHub Reference  ([#4183](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4183))

We've updated the way the internal [Webiny Telemetry Service (WTS)](https://github.com/webiny/wts) client is included in a Webiny project. Instead of referencing the client directly from GitHub, we now use the NPM package. 

We've made this change because we've seen a couple of users bumping into issues when upgrading their projects. Basically, the client would not be downloaded correctly from GitHub, causing the project to fail to build.

This way, the package will be installed from the NPM registry, which should make the upgrade process smoother.

## Other

### Allow editors to adjust the column width within the ACO list ([#4179](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4179))

Prior to this release, editors were unable to adjust the column width, which could be problematic in cases of complex folder structures with multiple levels of nesting.

This has been resolved: editors can now adjust the column width based on their needs. The configuration is saved within the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring that the system remembers latest column width settings for a more personalized and consistent user experience.
