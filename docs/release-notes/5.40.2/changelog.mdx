## Deployment

## Increased Memory Size For AWS Lambda Functions to 1024MB ([#4197](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4197))

With this release, we've increased the memory size for all AWS Lambda functions to 1024MB. This change will help improve the performance of your Webiny applications.

In terms of cost, note that this change should not have a significant impact on your AWS bill. The cost increase should be minimal or even non-existent, depending on your usage. This is because AWS Lambda pricing is based on the number of invocations, the duration of each invocation, and the amount of memory allocated to the function. By increasing the memory size, the duration of each invocation will be shorter, which can result even in lower costs.
