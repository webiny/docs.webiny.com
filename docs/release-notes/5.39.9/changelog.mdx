### Published Records Updated Correctly Upon Calling `createRevisionFrom`  ([#4184](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4184))

Prior to this release, when immediately publishing a revision created using the `createRevisionFrom` method, the revision's internal "published" record would not be updated correctly. This would cause the old published revisions to still be returned when performing queries.

This issue has been fixed, and now the published record is updated correctly when calling the `createRevisionFrom` method.

<Alert type={"warning"}>

  This fix has been first introduced with the 5.40.1 release, but it was backported to the 5.39.9 release as well. When planning to upgrade to 5.40.x, please make sure to upgrade to 5.40.1 or later (the [5.40.0 upgrade guide](/docs/release-notes/5.40.0/upgrade-guide#1-upgrade-webiny-packages) already suggests that).

### Added Model ID and Used Index Name When Logging Ignored ES Response Errors ([#4186](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4186))

<Alert type={"info"}>

  This improvement only applies to projects that use [Amazon DynamoDB + Amazon OpenSearch database setup](/docs/{version}/architecture/introduction#different-database-setups).

</Alert>

We've improved the logging of **ignored** ElasticSearch response errors by adding the model ID and the index name to the log message. This will make it easier to identify which model and index the error is related to.

Note that the errors we're referring to here are errors that are, in most cases, not critical to the operation of the system, which is the reason they are ignored in the first place. These errors are ignored because they are usually related to the fact that a record is not yet indexed, which is expected behavior in some cases.

## Data Migrations

### Improved Disablement and Restoration of ElasticSearch Indexing Settings ([#4187](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4187))

<Alert type={"info"}>

  These improvements only apply to projects that use [Amazon DynamoDB + Amazon OpenSearch database setup](/docs/{version}/architecture/introduction#different-database-setups).

</Alert>

With this release, we've made a couple of improvements to the way ElasticSearch indexing settings are disabled and restored during data migrations. To provide context, when a data migration is run, we disable indexing on the index, perform the migration, and then restore the original settings. This is done to prevent indexing operations from happening during the migration, which speeds up the process and reduces the load on the database.

The changes are as follows.

First of all, when disabling indexing on an index, we no longer set the `number_of_replicas` setting to zero. Instead, we now do not touch this setting at all. This is because setting it to zero can cause data loss in case a shard is lost, as explained [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules.html#dynamic-index-settings), and also [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/tune-for-indexing-speed.html#_disable_refresh_and_replicas_for_initial_loads).

Secondly, we've addressed an index settings restoration issue, which would happen if a user manually stopped a data migration and then reran it. More specifically, if a migration was stopped manually and then rerun, the restoration step would incorrectly again set the "disable indexing" settings. This is because it would use the index settings that were retrieved at the beginning of the new run, which, because the previous run has been manually stopped, still contain `refresh_interval: -1`. Ultimately, this setting would be applied when restoring index settings, effectively leaving the "indexing: disabled" setting still active.

### 5.39.6-001 Data Migration - Added Support For `WEBINY_MIGRATION_FORCE_EXECUTE_5_39_6_001` Environment Variable ([#4188](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4188))

With this release, we've added the ability to force the execution of the improved `5.39.6-001` data migration by setting the `WEBINY_MIGRATION_FORCE_EXECUTE_5_39_6_001` environment variable to `true`. This can be useful in cases where the migration has already been run, but you want to rerun it.

Note that this was already possible with all of the other data migrations, but the improved `5.39.6-001` data migration, that we released with the [5.39.6 release](/docs/release-notes/5.39.7/changelog#further-improving-the-5-39-6-001-data-migration-4154), did not support this feature. This has been fixed with this release.
