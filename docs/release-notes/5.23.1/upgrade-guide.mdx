## 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

Upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages by running the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.23.1"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.23.1`.

<Alert type="info">

You don't need to deploy anything, as this release only addresses a problem with the `watch` command, which is only used in local development.
