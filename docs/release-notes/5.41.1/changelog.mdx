### External Identity Providers - Roles and Teams Assignments ([#4349](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4349)]

We've addressed a couple of issues related to assigning roles when using external identity providers, like [Auth0](/docs/enterprise/auth0-integration) or [Okta](/docs/enterprise/okta-integration). We've also added one new feature. More information can be found below.

#### 1. `groups` Property Now Works As Expected

Prior to this release, when using external identity providers, assigning roles via the newly introduced `groups` property would not work. For example, with Auth0, the following configuration would not work:

```diff-ts
    /**
     * Configure Auth0 authentication and authorization.
     */
    createAuth0({
        /**
         * `domain` is required for token verification.
         */
        domain: String(process.env.WEBINY_API_AUTH0_DOMAIN),
        /**
         * Construct the identity object and map token claims
         * to arbitrary identity properties.
         */
        getIdentity({ token }) {
            return {
                id: token["sub"],
                type: "admin",
                displayName: token["name"],
                
+               // This would work.
+               group: "full-access",

-               // This would not work.
-               groups: ["full-access"],
            };
        }
    }),
```

With this release, this has been addressed and both `group` and `groups` properties can now be used to assign roles when using external identity providers.

<Alert>

  As mentioned in the [5.41.0 release notes](/docs/release-notes/5.41.0/changelog), the `group` property has been deprecated. Users are encouraged to use the `groups` property instead.

</Alert>

#### 2. Programmatically Created Roles Now Work As Expected

When using external identity providers, trying to assign a role to a user that was programmatically created would not work. This has now been addressed.

<Alert>

  Programmatic creation of roles and teams has been introduced in the [5.41.0 release](/docs/release-notes/5.41.0/changelog#programmatic-creation-of-roles-and-teams-4303).

</Alert>

#### 3. Ability To Assign Teams ([#4349](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4349)]

Since the introduction of the Teams feature, users were not able to assign teams to users when using external identity providers. With this release, this gap has finally been closed.

<Alert type="info">

  Note that the Teams feature is part of Webiny's enterprise offering. To learn more, please check out the
  [Teams](/docs/enterprise/aacl/teams) article.

[//]: # (We've introduced a new type of an extension called Page Builder element.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Once run, the extension will make sure a users ends up with all of the required files and configurations for a new Page Builder element plugin. This will make it easier for users to start developing new Page Builder elements.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (The extension can be accessed like any other extension, via the `yarn webiny scaffold` command, by then selecting **New Extension** from the list of all available scaffolds, and ultimately choosing **Page Builder Element**.)

### New "Website" Extension ([#4344](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4344))

With the new **Page Builder element** extension, we've also introduced the new **Website** extension, which makes it easier to start extending Webiny's **Website** application.

As already mentioned above, in the same fashion, the extension can be accessed via the `webiny scaffold`, or the new [`webiny extension`](/docs/release-notes/5.41.1/changelog#the-webiny-extension-command) command.

Essentially, instead of using plain JavaScript objects, users will now do the same via React components.)

<Alert>

  At the moment, there aren't any code examples that include the new **Website** extension. We'll be adding them in the upcoming releases.

## Development

### Improved Error Messages ([#4341](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4341))

Prior to this release, in case a user immediately tried to [watch](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/watch-command) the **Admin** or **Website** frontend applications, but the **Core** and **API** applications weren't deployed, they would receive an error message that wasn't very helpful. We've improved this error message to provide more context and help users understand what's going on.

### The `webiny extension` Command

Up until now, in order to scaffold a new extension, users had to run the `yarn webiny scaffold` command, and then select **New Extension** from the list of all available scaffolds. And although this isn't a big deal, still, since extensions are becoming more and more important in the last couple of releases, we've decided to introduce a new command called [`webiny extension`](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/webiny-cli#yarn-webiny-extension).

Essentially, everything stays the same, but now, instead of running `yarn webiny scaffold`, users can run `yarn webiny extension` to scaffold a new extension.

Note that the `webiny scaffold` command will still work, but moving forward, we'll be emphasizing the use of the new `webiny extension` command.
