[5.29.0](/docs/release-notes/5.29.0/changelog). In case you did not already migrate, please visit the [migration
guide](/docs/release-notes/5.29.0/project-setup-migration).

## Step-by-Step Guide

The following steps will guide you through the upgrade process. Please note that this guide assumes you are using the [new project setup](/docs/release-notes/5.29.0/changelog#brand-new-project-setup), introduced with Webiny [5.29.0](/docs/release-notes/5.29.0/changelog). In case you did not already migrate, please visit the [migration guide](/docs/release-notes/5.29.0/project-setup-migration).

### 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

Upgrade all Webiny NPM packages by running the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.37.3"
```

<Alert type={"danger"}>

  Note the `5.37.3` version in the command above. We strongly recommend users to immediately upgrade to the latest patch version, as with [this release](/docs/release-notes/5.37.3/changelog), we've addressed an important data migrations-related issue.
  
</Alert>

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return **5.37.3**.

### 2. Run the Upgrade Command

The next step is to run the project upgrade:

```bash
yarn webiny upgrade
```

### 3. Deploy Your Project

Proceed by redeploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```

## Additional Notes

### Updating Your Custom API Plugins

As described in the changelog, there's now a new lifecycle event, [onTenantAfterInstall](/docs/{version}/release-notes/5.37.0/changelog#add-on-tenant-after-install-lifecycle-event-3377), which serves as a single, reliable place to hook into Webiny app installation for each tenant, and add things like initial data setup, etc. If you're currently using events like `pageBuilder.onSystemAfterInstall`, or `cms.onSystemAfterInstall`, we highly recommend updating your code to use the new event `tenancy.onTenantAfterInstall`.

The reason this is important to do is that, with the `5.37.0` release, we changed the order of app installation, and moved the Headless CMS app to be one of the first ones to be installed, because now File Manager depends on the Headless CMS. This change should only take a few moments to do, but it will make your system much more reliable, and future-proof.

Simply look for the `AfterInstall` string in your custom plugins to find all references to the legacy events, and modify the code to look something like this:

```ts
new ContextPlugin(context => {
  context.tenancy.onTenantAfterInstall.subscribe(() => {
    // All of your existing logic goes here.
  });
});
```

### Legacy Rich Text Editor Support After the Upgrade

After the upgrade to the new 5.37.0 version, we will still support the legacy editor.

Here is how it works.

- Legacy Rich Text editor will appear for the existing content.
- For the new models, you can choose between the Legacy (EditorJs) and Lexical Rich Text editors. We **recommend** Lexical Editor to write your next content.
- We use the feature flag **allowCmsLegacyRichTextInput** to support both editors.

In the Rich Text field settings form, click the **Appearance tab** you will see this message:

<Image
  src={hcmsFieldSettingWithFeatureFlag}
  title={"Support of the Legacy Rich Text editor after upgrade"}
/>

That means the **feature flag** is set in the project to support the Legacy Rich Text editor as option for the new models.
**Remove the feature flag** and Lexical editor will be default editor for the Rich Text field (recommended).

As shown in the screenshot, in the **root** of project open **webiny.project.ts** and remove the feature flag.

<Image src={hcmsRemoveFeatureFlag} title={"Remove the feature flag"} />
Now, after removing the feature flag, create a new model and drop the new Rich Text field. You can see
now that Lexical Editor is the default option in the field settings.
<Image
  src={hcmsFieldSettingRemovedFeatureFlag}
  title={"Lexical editor as default Rich Text field option in Headless CMS"}
/>
<Alert title={"After removing the feature flag..."} type={"info"}>
  By removing the feature flag, the legacy Rich Text editor will no longer appear as a choice for
  the new models and fields. Still, the legacy editor will appear for the existing content created
  by this editor.
