## System

### Node.js v18 ([#3561](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3561))

With this release we have updated the system to Node.js `v18`.
Unfortunately, there are some breaking changes coming with the dependency updates:

- `aws-sdk` has been bumped to `3.425.0` - because the `v2.x.x` does not work with the Node.js `v18`
- `dynamodb-toolbox` has been bumped to `0.9.2` - because the previous version, we were using, does not work with `aws-sdk` `v3.x.x`

This was a quite large update, with over **750** files changed in our repository, so if you encounter any issues - please let us know.

## Multi-Event Handler ([#3710](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3710))

Until this release, the Lambda Handler was only able to handle a single type of the event.

For example, if you wanted to have a Lambda function which handled the **S3** event, you had to import the `createHandler` function from `@webiny/handler-aws/s3`.

From now on, for all AWS events we support, you can use the `createHandler` function from `@webiny/handler-aws` package.
Of course, you can still use the old way of importing specific `createHandler` (s3, dynamodb, etc...) - we will not remove those.

To find out more about the Handlers, please read [this](/docs/core-development-concepts/basics/routes-and-events) article.
