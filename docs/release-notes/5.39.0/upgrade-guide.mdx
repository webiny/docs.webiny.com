## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

Upgrade all Webiny NPM packages by running the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.39.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return **5.39.0**.

### 2. Run the Upgrade Command

The next step is to run the project upgrade:

```bash
yarn webiny upgrade
```

### 3. Breaking Changes

#### 3.1 Headless CMS - Date/Time and Identity (On/By) Meta Fields

As mentioned in the [changelog](docs/release-notes/5.39.0/changelog#headless-cms-revamped-date-time-and-identity-on-by-meta-fields), with this release, we’ve revamped the date/time and identity-related meta fields. In order to do this, we had to introduce a couple of Headless CMS-related breaking changes.

Will these breaking changes affect you? It depends on if you've been adding custom code in your project, in which you are also relying on the existing content entry meta fields, like `ownedBy`, `publishedOn`, or `createdOn`. For example, you may have have been using these in your: 

1. custom Headless CMS-related GraphQL API queries or mutations
2. custom Headless CMS-related JavaScript (TypeScript) code (for example, [lifecycle events](/docs/headless-cms/references/lifecycle-events))

If you don't have any of the above, you can safely skip this section. Otherwise, please take a look at the [Date/Time and Identity (On/By) Meta Fields](/docs/release-notes/5.39.0/date-time-and-id-meta-fields) article.

#### 3.2 Deployments - New IAM Permissions (Allowed Actions) Required

✍️

### 4. Deploy Your Project

Proceed by redeploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```
