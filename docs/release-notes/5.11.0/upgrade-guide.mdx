- how to upgrade Webiny from 5.10.0 to 5.11.0

</Alert>

<Alert type="danger">

Before continuing, make sure to take the necessary precautions, listed in the [Overview](/docs/release-notes/upgrade-webiny#-precaution-measures) section.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

Make sure to check out the [5.11.0 changelog](/docs/release-notes/5.11.0/changelog) to get familiar with all the changes introduced in this release.

</Alert>

## 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

Upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages by running the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.11.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.11.0`.

<Alert type="info">

Before moving on, make sure you commit all your changes.

</Alert>

## 2. Run the Upgrade Command

The next step is to run the project upgrade:

```bash
yarn webiny upgrade 5.11.0
```

Once the upgrade command has finished, you can run the [`git status`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) command to see all changes that the command performed.

## 3. Deploy Your Project

Finally, proceed by redeploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```

<Alert type="warning">

As stated in the [Upgrade Webiny](/docs/release-notes/upgrade-webiny#pre-production-environments-first) section, we recommend that you first deploy your changes into one of your pre-production environments, like `dev` or `staging`.

</Alert>

<Alert type="success">

## Additional Notes

### Pulumi v3 Upgrade

<Alert type="danger">

As stated in the [Upgrade Webiny](/docs/release-notes/upgrade-webiny#pre-production-environments-first) section, to prevent any data loss or other critical problems that might occur while upgrading, we recommend that you first deploy your changes into one of your pre-production environments, like `dev` or `staging`.

</Alert>

As mentioned in the [changelog](/docs/release-notes/5.11.0/changelog), from the 5.11.0 release, all Webiny projects will use [Pulumi](/docs/infrastructure/pulumi-iac/iac-with-pulumi) v3.

In terms of existing projects and upgrading, there shouldn't be any major changes or extra steps that you'll need to perform. But, there are a couple of things to have in mind.

Once you've run the above shown `webiny upgrade` command, the existing Pulumi CLI should automatically be removed from your project. And, upon redeploying your Webiny project (using the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/core-development-concepts/basics/project-deployment) command), the new Pulumi CLI should be downloaded and installed, again automatically.

Furthermore, during the first deployment, in case you didn't make any changes that would affect the deployment, you should only see a change in `provider` for each cloud infrastructure resource:

![First Deploy After Upgrade](./upgrade-guide/first-deploy-after-upgrade.png)

In order to test this out, we suggest you use the `--preview` flag, which will enable you to see all of the changes that will be performed in the new deployment, for example:

```bash
yarn webiny deploy api --env {env} --preview
```

#### Troubleshooting

In case something is not behaving as expected, we recommend you check the following things.

If the suggested solutions to mentioned problems still don't help, feel free to contact us via our [community Slack](https://www.webiny.com/slack), we'd be glad to provide additional assistance.

##### Ensure All Packages Are at the Exact Same Version

In a couple of cases, we've seen multiple versions of the [`@pulumi/pulumi`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pulumi/pulumi) package being used within a single Webiny project. This should not happen.

You can use the `yarn why @pulumi/pulumi` command to see which package versions are being used.

If it turns out that multiple package versions are being used, then try running `yarn` from your project root, or simply install all dependencies from scratch, for example by cloning the project and installing.

##### Ensure There Is No Pulumi CLI Globally Installed

A couple of times, we've seen the following error starting to occur, after a Webiny project was upgraded to 5.11.0:

![Pulumi CLI Error](./upgrade-guide/pulumi-cli-error.png)

We've discovered that this issue can be resolved by simply removing Pulumi CLI as a globally installed tool. For example, if you were using MacOS and installed the Pulumi CLI via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), then uninstalling it via `brew uninstall pulumi` would solve the shown issue.
