## Replace Various Dependencies ([#4712](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4712))

We've replaced some of the outdated dependencies that were pulling in packages with vulnerabilities.

- `crypto-browserify` polyfill is no longer included with webpack (it was only needed because of `crypto` being used in `@webiny/utils` which is used across environments)
- in `@webiny/utils` package we no longer use `crypto`, but a `@noble/hashes` package, which provides hashing utilities, and works across environments (0 dependencies)
- `mdbid` package was replaced with `bson-objectid` which works across environments (0 dependencies)
- `jwk-to-pem` was replaced with `jose` (used and sponsored by Auth0)
- `webpack-dev-server` was updated to the latest version (`5.2.2`)


## Execute `onClose` Callback When Dialog is Closed ([#4694](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4694))

We've fixed an issue with dialogs where the `onClose` callback was never executed.
