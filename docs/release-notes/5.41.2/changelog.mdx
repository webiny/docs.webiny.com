## Headless CMS

### Persist Error Snackbars ([#4392](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4392))

✍️

### Define Columns for Object and Dynamic Zone Fields in Entry List Table ([#4388](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4388))

This release introduces a major update to the Headless CMS entry list table, enabling developers to define columns for complex field types. This enhancement brings greater flexibility and customization while maintaining optimal performance.

Previously, the entry list table supported only simple field types: `text`, `number`, `boolean`, `file`, `long-text`, `ref`, `datetime`.

Now, developers can define columns for complex fields such as `object` and `dynamicZone`.

✍️

### Improved Trash Bin Emptying for Multi-Tenant Instances ([#4351](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4351))

When clearing deleted entries in environments with multiple tenants, parallel deletion tasks often led to errors due to resource contention and excessive parallelization.

This update consolidates the deletion process into a single task that iterates through all tenants, locales, and models sequentially. By processing eligible entries in series, the system ensures stability and improved performance, particularly for instances with a large number of tenants or locales.

This change enhances the robustness of the trash bin emptying operation and prevents potential failures caused by overly aggressive parallel task execution.

### Improve Editor Experience with Current Page List Information ([#4397](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4397))

This update provides editors with additional insights into the data they are working with, improving usability and overall efficiency.

Editors will now see:
* **Total Entries Count**: displays the total number of entries matching the current query or folder.
* **Current Entries Length**: a real-time indicator of the number of entries currently loaded in the interface.

This enhancement has been rolled out to the following applications:
* Headless CMS
* Page Builder
* File Manager
