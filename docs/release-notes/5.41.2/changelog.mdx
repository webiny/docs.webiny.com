## Headless CMS

### Persisted Error Messages ([#4392](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4392))

Up until now, error messages in the Admin UI would disappear after a short period of time, making it difficult for users to read and understand them. 

With this change, error snackbars will now persist until the user dismisses them.

## Page Builder

### Fixed Applying Separate Border Radius Values ([#4369](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4369))

We've fixed an issue where, in the Page Builder's page editor, applying separate border radius values (top left, top right, bottom right, bottom left) to a page element would not work as expected. This has now been addressed.

## Deployments

### Website Cloudfront Distributions - Ignore Changes In `staging` Property ([#4401](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4401))

Upon deploying Admin and Website applications, Webiny deploys a couple of Cloudfront distributions. Once initially deployed, during subsequent deployments, the distributions are only updated with the new changes. They are never recreated from scratch.

  Learn more about Webiny's cloud architecture in the [Cloud Architecture](/docs/architecture/introduction) documentation.

</Alert>

However, with the introduction of the new Pulumi version and because of a change in the way Pulumi handles the [`staging`](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/aws/api-docs/cloudfront/distribution/#staging_nodejs) property, the Cloudfront distributions would actually be recreated on the next deployment, which is certainly not the desired behavior. Especially if a custom domain was already associated with the distribution.

To fix this, we had to internally instruct Pulumi to ignore changes in the `staging` property, which will prevent the distributions from being recreated.


<Alert type={"warning"}>

  To this day, we've neved seen anybody relying on the `stating` property, so we're confident this change won't affect anyone. Still, if you are using it, please do give us a shout via our [community Slack](https://www.webiny.com/slack).

### Skip "First Deployment" Check When In CI Environment ([#4408](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4408))

When users deploy their project for the first time via the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/core-development-concepts/basics/project-deployment) command, Webiny shows the following short message:

<Image src={firstDeployment} alt="First Deployment Message" />

And although this message can be helpful when really deploying for the first time from a local environment, it's not really necessary when deploying from a CI environment. In one particular case, we've even seen this message being shown incorrectly, despite the fact that the project was already deployed (more on this in the linked [pull request](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4408)).

To address this, we've simply decided to skip this check when deploying from a CI environment.

## Other Improvements

### Lifecycle Event Handlers - Add Error Logging ([#4391](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4391)) 

We've added basic error logging during the execution of lifecycle event handlers.

This will help users debug issues because. Not only will they be able to see the newly added logs in their [Amazon CloudWatch logs](https://webiny.link/cloudwatch), but also, in their browser.

The following example shows a log that happened because of an error that occurred during the [`onEntryBeforePublish`](/docs/headless-cms/references/lifecycle-events#on-entry-before-publish) lifecycle event:

<Image src={errorLoggingEventHandlers} alt="Error Logging Event Handlers" shadow={false}/>

<Alert>

  In case you missed it, with the `DEBUG` env variable set to `true`, all the logs that occur during a single GraphQL HTTP request are actually forwarded to user's browser console.

<Alert>

  The `DEBUG` env variable is usually used with dev and pre-prod Webiny instances. To learn more, check out the [Environment Variables](/docs/core-development-concepts/basics/environment-variables#debug) documentation.
