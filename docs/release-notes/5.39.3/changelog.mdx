### Webiny CLI - Updated Internal Dependencies ([#3986](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3986))

We've received multiple reports of new users not being able to build and access **Admin Area** and **Website** frontend apps.

After a quick investigation, we've found that the issue was caused because of a number of updates that happened within [Browserify](https://github.com/browserify/browserify) packages, which Webiny uses internally when building mentioned apps.

The issues have been addressed and both **Admin Area** and **Website** frontend apps should now build and work as expected.
