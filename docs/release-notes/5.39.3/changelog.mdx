## File Manager
### Enhance Filtering Mechanism ([#3978](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3978))

In this release, we have refined the filtering behavior within the File Manager. Previously, when the user reset all filters, the files were loaded without specifying the folder location.

Now, with the updated logic, if no filters are set or contain undefined values, entries will be loaded based on their respective locations.

## Page Builder
### Fix Missing Actions in Page Details Drawer ([#3982](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3982))

This update effectively resolves an issue encountered when AACL (Advanced Access Control Layer) is enabled. Specifically, it addresses a situation where pages located within the root folder inadvertently caused certain actions within the Page Details drawer to disappear.

## Other

### Webiny CLI - Updated Internal Dependencies ([#3986](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3986))

We've received multiple reports of new users not being able to build and access **Admin Area** and **Website** frontend apps.

After a quick investigation, we've found that the issue was caused because of a number of updates that happened within [Browserify](https://github.com/browserify/browserify) packages, which Webiny uses internally when building mentioned apps.

The issues have been addressed and both **Admin Area** and **Website** frontend apps should now build and work as expected.
