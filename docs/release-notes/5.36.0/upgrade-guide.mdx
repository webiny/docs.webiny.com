## Step-by-Step Guide

The following steps will guide you through the upgrade process. Please note that this guide assumes you are using the [new project setup](/docs/release-notes/5.29.0/changelog#brand-new-project-setup), introduced with Webiny [5.29.0](/docs/release-notes/5.29.0/changelog). In case you did not already migrate, please visit the [migration guide](/docs/release-notes/5.29.0/project-setup-migration).

### 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

Upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages by running the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.36.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.36.0`.

### 2. Run the Upgrade Command

The next step is to run the project upgrade:

```bash
yarn webiny upgrade
```

### 3. Deploy Your Project

Proceed by redeploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```

### Additional Notes

With this release, we significantly improved our file uploading capabilities, enabling support for files up to a whopping 5TB in size.
Remember to review the default **Maximum file upload size** limit you find within the File Manager Settings page (**Main Navigation -> Settings -> File Manager**).

Make sure you deploy the entire system using the command shown above! You have to deploy all apps before using the
system. Partial deploys may cause the upgrade to be applied incorrectly.

<Alert type="warning">

As stated in the [Upgrade Webiny](/docs/release-notes/upgrade-webiny#pre-production-environments-first) section, we recommend that you
first deploy your changes into one of your pre-production environments, like `dev` or `staging`.
