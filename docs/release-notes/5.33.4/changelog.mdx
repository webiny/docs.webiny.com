## Deployments

### Improved "Deploy Webiny Project" AWS CloudFormation Template ([#2856](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2856))

In case you missed it, in our previous [5.33.2](/docs/release-notes/5.33.2/changelog#updated-deploy-webiny-project-cloud-formation-template-2773) release, we've revisited our `DeployWebinyProject` [AWS CloudFormation template](/docs/{version}/infrastructure/aws/configure-aws-credentials#deploy-webiny-project-aws-cloud-formation-template) and updated the set of permissions it deploys through multiple Amazon IAM policies.

But, we didn't stop there! With this release, we've taken it even further and ensured that the template and the list of permissions it includes fully follows the [Principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege), making it more secure and easier for organizations to adopt it.

To quickly check out the changes, you can visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/stable/docs/DEPLOY_WEBINY_PROJECT_CF_TEMPLATE.yaml).

<Alert type="info" title="More Information">

In case you missed it, in order to deploy your Webiny project in a more controlled and secure manner, you can utilize our `DeployWebinyProject` [AWS CloudFormation template](/docs/{version}/infrastructure/aws/configure-aws-credentials#deploy-webiny-project-aws-cloud-formation-template). The template deploys necessary ([least-privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)) set of permissions into your AWS account, which also automatically get linked with an Amazon IAM user of your choosing (the user you plan to use upon running deployments).

</Alert>

### Introduced Prefixed Cloud Infrastructure (Pulumi) Resource Names ([#2858](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2858))

In order to make it easier to distinguish between Webiny-related deployed cloud infrastructure resources and other resources you already might have in your AWS account, apart from the [default tags](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/project-deployment#tagged-resources), we're now also prefixing every resource name with the `wby-` prefix. For example, if we were to take a look at the list of deployed AWS Lambda functions, we'd be able to see the following:

<Image
  title="Introduced Prefixed Cloud Infrastructure (Pulumi) Resource Names"
  src={lambdaFunctions}
/>

Note that the prefix will only be applied for new Webiny projects, created with version **5.33.4** or greater.

Still, if you'd like to adopt the same naming convention within an existing Webiny project, you can do that by utilizing the newly introduced `pulumiResourceNamePrefix` parameter, in your `webiny.application.ts` configuration files.

<Alert type={"danger"}>
  For existing projects that are already serving production workloads, we do not recommend
  performing the below steps. Changing cloud infrastructure resource name can cause a complete
  replacement of the resource, which might result in downtime or even a permanent data loss.
</Alert>

For example, in the `apps/core/webiny.application.ts` file, we'd need to perform the following addition:

```diff-ts
import { createCoreApp } from "@webiny/serverless-cms-aws";

export default createCoreApp({
+   pulumiResourceNamePrefix: "wby-"
});
```

The exact same addition then needs to be made in the remaining three `webiny.application.ts` files:

1. `apps/api/webiny.application.ts`
2. `apps/admin/webiny.application.ts`
3. `apps/website/webiny.application.ts`

Once performed, the final step is to redeploy your Webiny project, as usual, via the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/project-deployment) command.
