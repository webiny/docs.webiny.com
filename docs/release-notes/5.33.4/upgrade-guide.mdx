## 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

Upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages by running the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.33.4"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.33.4`.

## 2. Deploy Your Project

Proceed by redeploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```

<Alert type="warning">

Make sure you deploy your entire Webiny project using the command shown above. You have to deploy all applications before using the system. Partial deploys may cause the upgrade to be applied incorrectly.

</Alert>

<Alert type="warning">

As stated in the [Upgrade Webiny](/docs/{version}/release-notes/upgrade-webiny#pre-production-environments-first) section, we recommend that you first deploy your changes into one of your pre-production environments, like `dev` or `staging`.
