# Changes

## Development

### Locked Versions of `@pulumi/*` Packages ([#2089](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2089))

In attempt to make things a bit more stable, we've decided to put a lock on the `@pulumi/*` NPM package versions. Locking has been achieved via the [`resolutions`](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/manifest/#resolutions) property in the root `package.json` file.

:::info
`@pulumi/*` NPM packages are being utilized by Pulumi, the underlying infrastructure-as-code (IaC) solution Webiny relies on. To learn more, check out the [Infrastructure as Code With Pulumi](/docs/key-topics/deployment/iac-with-pulumi) key topic.
:::

:::note
For existing projects that are being upgraded to `5.19.0`, the `resolutions` property will be updated via the [`webiny upgrade`](/docs/release-notes/5.19.0/upgrade-guide#2-run-the-upgrade-command) command.

### Pulumi SDK - Using Correct Separator When Constructing `PATH` Environment Variable ([#2084](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2084))

Because of an issue in the construction of the `PATH` environment variable in our internal [Pulumi SDK](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/next/packages/pulumi-sdk), on non-Windows operating systems, users might've experienced an issue during deployment of their custom project applications. This has now been addressed, so new deployments should work as expected.

Thank you goes to [**@snstanton**](https://github.com/snstanton) for discovering this! ️️❤️

### Fixed Incorrect AWS Profile Being Logged During Deployment ([#2078](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2078))

In order to use the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project) command, AWS credentials need to be set, which can be done in [multiple ways](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/aws/configure-aws-credentials).

When relying on environment variables, users can choose to either use a combination of `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, or a single `AWS_PROFILE` variable. In case of the former, we've noticed that, during deployment, an incorrect message would get displayed in the terminal, saying AWS profile "undefined" is being used.

This has now been addressed. From now on, when a combination of `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables is used, the AWS Access Key ID will be displayed instead.

### New `acl` and `cacheControl` Options on the `uploadFolderToS3` Function ([#2066](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2066), [#2083](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2083))

The [`uploadFolderToS3`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/0de898563ff84bf47d6aa740c2e43773f7c2d90e/packages/cli-plugin-deploy-pulumi/utils/aws/uploadFolderToS3.d.ts#L8) is a small utility function that is used to upload a complete folder directly to an Amazon S3 bucket. At the moment, it's used when you deploy your Admin Area and Website project applications, within [`apps/admin/cli/deploy.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/admin/cli/deploy.ts#L39) and [`apps/admin/cli/deploy.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/common/apps/admin/cli/deploy.ts#L39), respectively.

With this release, we've improved this utility function, by enabling users to specify the [`acl`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/0de898563ff84bf47d6aa740c2e43773f7c2d90e/packages/cli-plugin-deploy-pulumi/utils/aws/uploadFolderToS3.d.ts#L22) and [`cacheControl`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/0de898563ff84bf47d6aa740c2e43773f7c2d90e/packages/cli-plugin-deploy-pulumi/utils/aws/uploadFolderToS3.d.ts#L23) properties that will be set for every uploaded file.

Once again, a big thank you to [**@snstanton**](https://github.com/snstanton) for implementing this nifty improvement! 🍻

:::tip
The `acl` property lets you set **Canned ACL** for every uploaded file. To learn more, check out [official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#Canned%20ACL).

### `webiny deploy` Command - Introduced `--deploy` Flag ([#2096](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2096))

A new `--deploy` flag has been added to the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project).

By setting it to false (by passing `--no-deploy`), this small addition allows users to skip the deployment step, which can be useful if they only want to build the specified project application. For example:

```bash
yarn webiny deploy api --env dev --no-deploy
```

### `webiny watch` Command - Fixed Multiline Logs ([#2103](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2103))

Previously, if you were to add multiline logs in your cloud infrastructure (Pulumi) code, the [`webiny watch`](/docs/how-to-guides/use-watch-command/#can-i-use-the-webiny-watch-command-to-start-a-watch-process-on-frontend-react-apps) command's terminal output would get truncated. This has now been addressed, so you can freely add any additional multiline logs that you might need.

## Page Builder

### Button Page Element - Ability to Register A Custom Callback Handler ([#2022](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2022))

Prior to this release, we could say the default Button page element was a bit "basic", since it was only capable of representing a link and nothing else. But, not anymore.

Thanks to [**@econtentmaps**](https://github.com/econtentmaps), the Button page element can now also be configured to execute a piece of code (a click handler) that you previously registered via the new [`PbButtonElementClickHandlerPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5/packages/app-page-builder/src/types.ts#L260) plugin.

<CenteredImage
  src={pageBuilderBtnAction}
  title={"The highlight of this release - the new Amazon DynamoDB-only version of Webiny!"}
/>

Here are a couple of quick examples that show how to use this new plugin type:

```ts
import { PbButtonElementClickHandlerPlugin } from "@webiny/app-page-builder/types";

export default [
  // Registers a simple click handler that doesn't depend on any variables.
  {
    type: "pb-page-element-button-click-handler",
    name: "simple-handler",
    title: "A Simple Handler",
    // Once the button is clicked, we display a simple alert message.
    handler: params => {
      alert("I was clicked!");
    }
  },
  // Registers a click handler that depends on two variables (color and size).
  {
    type: "pb-page-element-button-click-handler",
    name: "handler-with-variables",
    title: "Handler With Variables",
    // Here are the variables that users will be able to set via the
    // button's "Action" settings (in the Page Builder editor).
    variables: [
      { name: "color", label: "My Color", defaultValue: "red" },
      { name: "size", label: "My Size", defaultValue: "XXL" }
    ],
    // Once the button is clicked, we simply log the received variables.
    handler: function({ variables }) {
      console.log(variables); // Logs { color, size } object.
    }
  } as PbButtonElementClickHandlerPlugin<{ color: string; type: string }>
];
```

## Headless CMS

### Searching the Reference Field for Any Version of the Entry ([#2067](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2068))

For example, we have models `Category` and `Article`, and `Category` is a single value ref field on the `Article` model.
Prior to *5.19.0* you could not search all `Articles` that have `Category`, for example, *My Category* in any version. From now on, you will be able to.
Here is an example of the GraphQL Query for it:
```graphql
{
	listArticles(
		where: {
			category: {
				entryId: "61a8c8a4625b0c0008fc8652"
			}
		}
	) {
		data {
			id
			category {
				id
			}
		}
	}
}
```


### Uppercase and Lowercase Field Validators With Space ([#2080](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2080))

We added new validators that will match either *A-Z + space* or *a-z + space*.
They are available in newly created projects from 5.19.0 onward.

If you need them in your existing project, you will need to add them in your `apps/admin/code/src/plugins/headlessCms.ts` file.

You need to add 4 plugins in total:

```typescript title="apps/admin/code/src/plugins/headlessCms.ts"
import lowerCaseSpaceFieldValidator from "@webiny/app-headless-cms/admin/plugins/validators/patternPlugins/lowerCaseSpace";
import upperCaseSpaceFieldValidator from "@webiny/app-headless-cms/admin/plugins/validators/patternPlugins/upperCaseSpace";

import editorLowerCaseSpaceFieldValidator from "@webiny/app-headless-cms/admin/plugins/fieldValidators/patternPlugins/lowerCaseSpace";
import editorUpperCaseSpaceFieldValidator from "@webiny/app-headless-cms/admin/plugins/fieldValidators/patternPlugins/upperCaseSpace";
```

And, of course, add them to the default export array:

```typescript
export default [
	// ...existing plugins
	lowerCaseSpaceFieldValidator,
	upperCaseSpaceFieldValidator,
	editorLowerCaseSpaceFieldValidator,
	editorUpperCaseSpaceFieldValidator,
];
```
