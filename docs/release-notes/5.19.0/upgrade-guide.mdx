## 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

Upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages by running the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.19.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.19.0`.

The next step is to run the project upgrade:

yarn webiny upgrade
```

Once the upgrade command has finished, you can run the [`git status`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) command to see all changes that the command performed.

## 3. Deploy Your Project

Finally, proceed by re-deploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```

## 4. Upgrade in the Admin Area

There is a database upgrade that we execute from the Admin Area. To make sure it starts, clear your browser cache and log in.

When upgrade screen shows, just follow the instructions.


:::caution
As stated in the [Overview](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny#pre-production-environments-first) section, we recommend that you first deploy your changes into one of your pre-production environments, like `dev` or `staging`.
