- how to upgrade Webiny from 5.4.0 to 5.5.0

</Alert>

<Alert type="danger">

Before continuing, make sure to take the necessary precautions, listed in the [Overview](/docs/{version}/release-notes/upgrade-webiny#-precaution-measures) section.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

Make sure to check out the [5.5.0 changelog](/docs/{version}/release-notes/5.5.0/changelog) to get familiar with all the changes introduced in this release.

## Upgrade Webiny Packages

The first step is to upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages, which can be done by running the following command in the root of your project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.5.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.5.0`.

## Upgrade Webiny Project

<Alert type="warning">

Before running the below `webiny upgrade` command, please run the following from your project root:

```bash
npx https://gist.github.com/doitadrian/80c1407e3b513f8e1daaf77ae9e4703b
```

Running this command will apply a minor fix to the `webiny upgrade` command that you're about to execute.

</Alert>

This release includes a couple of smaller changes on the project organization level. To make it easier, we provide a simple [Webiny CLI](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/webiny-cli) command that will automatically make all the necessary adjustments for you.

Once you've run the above upgrade command, run the following:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny upgrade 5.5.0
```

<Alert type="info">

Before running the `webiny upgrade` command, we recommend that you commit any active code changes you might have in your working branch.

</Alert>

### Additional Manual Upgrade Steps

Once the `webiny upgrade` command has finished, a couple of manual steps remain to be completed, after which, your project should be completely updated.

You can then proceed by committing the changes to your working branch and trying to [deploy](/docs/{version}/core-development-concepts/basics/project-deployment) the project to one of the development or pre-production environment.

#### 1. Add `apolloLinks.ts` file (located in your Website project application)

In your **Website** project application (`apps/website`), we need to add the new [`apolloLinks.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.5.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/apps/website/code/src/plugins/apolloLinks.ts) file, that contains a couple of plugins, necessary for resolving a couple of pre-rendering related [issues](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1569).

Copy and paste the above mentioned `apolloLinks.ts` file to `apps/website/code/src/plugins/apolloLinks.ts`, and also, make sure it's imported in the [index.ts](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.5.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/apps/website/code/src/plugins/index.ts), located in the same `plugins` folder:

```ts apps/website/code/src/plugins/index.ts
import { plugins } from "@webiny/plugins";
import imageComponent from "@webiny/app/plugins/image";
import pageBuilder from "./pageBuilder";
import formBuilder from "./formBuilder";
import apolloLinks from "./apolloLinks";

import theme from "theme";

plugins.register([imageComponent(), pageBuilder, formBuilder, apolloLinks(), theme()]);
```

#### 2. Update `Page` React component (located in your Website project application)

Open your `/apps/website/code/src/components/Page/index.tsx` file and replace its content with [the new one](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.5.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/apps/website/code/src/components/Page/index.tsx). This change is also related to new pre-rendering related fixes.

#### 3. Optionally, add necessary environment variables to enable newly introduced logs forwarding

The new `webiny watch` command enables you to [stream logs](/docs/{version}/release-notes/5.5.0/changelog#logs) from your application code directly to your terminal. And while all new projects will have this feature automatically enabled, there are a couple of manual steps that needs to be done for projects that are making the upgrade to version `5.5.0`.

In [api/pulumi/dev/index.ts](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.5.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/api/pulumi/dev/index.ts), upon instantiating both `Graphql` and `HeadlessCMS` classes, make sure to pass the `WEBINY_LOGS_FORWARD_URL: String(process.env.WEBINY_LOGS_FORWARD_URL)` as an environment variable.

With that, you will also need to add the `@webiny/handler-logs` dependency to [`api-graphql`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/api/code/graphql/package.json#L27) and [`api-headless-cms`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/api/code/headlessCMS/package.json#L21) packages, and register its plugins in respective [index.ts](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/api/code/graphql/src/index.ts#L25) / [index.ts](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/api/code/headlessCMS/src/index.ts#L17) files.

This will enable logs forwarding for your main GraphQL API and HeadlessCMS GraphQL API Lambda functions.

#### 4. Fix the `buildFunction` in the `transform` Lambda Function Handler

We've received several reports of the [`webiny.config.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/api/code/fileManager/transform/webiny.config.ts#L1) not importing the correct `buildFunction`. Before doing any deployments, please ensure that the config file imports the correct `buildFunction`:

```tsx
import { buildFunction } from "@webiny/api-file-manager/handlers/transform/bundle";
```

## Upgrade Headless CMS Permissions

After a successful deployment, open your Admin Area to execute the automated upgrade of Headless CMS permissions. It will update permissions data structure on user groups and API keys.

<Alert type="warning">

We recommend verifying your CMS permissions after the upgrade, to make sure they reflect exactly what is expected.
