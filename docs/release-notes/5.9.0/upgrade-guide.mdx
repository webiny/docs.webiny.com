- how to upgrade Webiny from 5.8.0 to 5.9.0

</Alert>

<Alert type="danger">

Before continuing, make sure to take the necessary precautions, listed in the [Overview](/docs/{version}/release-notes/upgrade-webiny#-precaution-measures) section.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

Make sure to check out the [5.9.0 changelog](/docs/{version}/release-notes/5.9.0/changelog) to get familiar with all the changes introduced in this release.

## 1. Project Preparation

First, we need to prepare your project for the upgrade process. With security packages refactor, some packages no longer exist, and if we try to upgrade dependencies straight away, `yarn` will complain. To fix that, we need to clean up your project first, to eliminate references to those deprecated packages.

In your project root, run the following:

```bash
npx https://gist.github.com/Pavel910/abc4c063eae8c18754d6a026d1fc1d06
```

## 2. Upgrade Webiny Packages

We're now ready to upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages! Run the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.9.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.9.0`.

<Alert type="info">

Before moving on, make sure you commit all your changes.

## 3. Run the Upgrade Command

Now let's run the project upgrade:

```bash
yarn webiny upgrade 5.9.0
```

The upgrade script will make a couple of changes to your existing **API** project application's code (located within the `api` folder). Once the upgrade command has finished, you can run the [`git status`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) command to see all changes that the command performed.

## 4. Post Upgrade Script

To finalize the upgrade, run the following command:

```bash
npx https://gist.github.com/Pavel910/4a7a9694945fffcc65b293de8091116b
```

This takes care of a small glitch in the upgrade process, which we noticed _after_ we released the 5.9.0 code. Gists to the rescue!

## 5. Deploy Your Project

Finally, proceed by redeploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```

<Alert type="warning">

As stated in the [Upgrade Webiny](/docs/{version}/release-notes/upgrade-webiny#pre-production-environments-first) section, we recommend that you first deploy your changes into one of your pre-production environments, like `dev` or `staging`.

## Additional Steps and Notes

### GraphQL API Package Scaffold

If you've been using the **GraphQL API Package** scaffold in your Webiny project prior to the `5.9.0` release, you will have to revisit the created [`types.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.8.0/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/src/types.ts#L7) file for each created package, and replace the following line:

```ts
import { TenancyContext } from "@webiny/api-security-tenancy/types";
```

Replace it with the following import statement:

```ts
import { TenancyContext } from "@webiny/api-tenancy/types";
```

This change is required simply because the `@webiny/api-security-tenancy` package doesn't exist anymore. Note that the new `@webiny/api-tenancy` package should already exist in your project, so there's no need to add it manually.
