- how to upgrade Webiny from 5.23.1 to 5.24.0

:::

:::info
This Webiny upgrade only requires an update of `npm` packages.
Make sure to check out the [5.24.0 changelog](/docs/release-notes/5.24.0/changelog) to get familiar with the changes introduced in this release.
:::

## 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

Upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages by running the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.24.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.24.0`.

:::warning
Because we are upgrading Typescript rules to get the project to the strict mode, there might be some build issues in your existing projects.

We do not change your projects `tsconfig.json` file with this upgrade. If you want to make it stricter, you will need to add stricter compiler option rules to that file.
:::

## 2. Deploy Your Project

Proceed by re-deploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```

:::caution
As stated in the [Upgrade Webiny](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny#pre-production-environments-first) section, we recommend that you first deploy your changes into one of your pre-production environments, like `dev` or `staging`.

:::tip
