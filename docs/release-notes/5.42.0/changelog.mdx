## Other Improvements

### `@webiny/api-serverless-cms` - Added `MailerContext` to `Context` Interface ([#4481](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4481))

We've added the `MailerContext` to the `Context` interface in the `@webiny/api-serverless-cms` package.

With this change, developers can now access the `context.mailer` object and all of its methods in a type-safe way.
