## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

Upgrade all Webiny NPM packages by running the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.42.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return **5.42.0**.

### 2. Upgrade Yarn to 4.6.0

<Alert type="warning">
  
  This is really important step, as the project upgrade will not work without the correct Yarn version.
  
</Alert>

We have updated the `Yarn` version to `4.6.0` and we cannot update it automatically in the project, so you need to do it manually.

To upgrade Yarn to version `4.6.0`, run the following command:

```bash
yarn set version 4.6.0 && yarn install
````

This will effectively set your project Yarn to v4.6.0 and install all the packages with that Yarn version.

### 3. Run the Upgrade Command

The next step is to run the project upgrade:

```bash
yarn webiny upgrade
```

### 4. Deploy Your Project

Proceed by redeploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```
