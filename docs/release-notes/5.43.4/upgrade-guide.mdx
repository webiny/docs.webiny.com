<Alert type="info">

</Alert>

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

Upgrade all Webiny NPM packages by running the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.43.4"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return **5.43.4**.

### 2. Run the Upgrade Command (Event If Upgrading From 5.43.x)

Before proceeding with the next step, make sure to check the [2. Run the Upgrade Command](/docs/release-notes/5.43.0/upgrade-guide#2-run-the-upgrade-command) section of the [Upgrade From 5.42.x to 5.43.0](/docs/release-notes/5.43.0/upgrade-guide) upgrade guide.

### 3. Update Your Project's Dependencies

Because this patch addresses some of the security vulnerabilities in Webiny dependencies, you must run some commands to make sure your project is using latest possible versions of those dependencies.

`yarn up crypto-browserify pbkdf2 fastify sha.js form-data cipher-base tmp -R`

<Alert type="warning">
  
  This step is required because some of the dependencies are not directly controlled by Webiny, and you need to update them manually.
  
</Alert>

```bash

### 4. Deploy Your Project

Proceed by redeploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```
