## Other Improvements

### Custom Fields for ACO Folders ([#4561](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4561))

With this update, developers can now extend the ACO folder model by adding custom fields. These fields are seamlessly integrated into the GraphQL schema and the Admin app UI, allowing for greater flexibility when organizing content.

Since ACO Folders are powered by Webinyâ€™s Headless CMS, adding a new field is as simple as defining it on the Folder model. Once added, the field will automatically appear under the extensions field in the GraphQL schema and will be available in the Admin app when creating or editing folders.

#### Plugin-Based Customization
Webiny provides specialized plugin factories to modify folder models based on their use case:

- **Headless CMS Folders**: use `createCmsFolderModelModifier` to extend folders for Headless CMS content models.
- **Page Builder Folders**: use `createPbPageFolderModelModifier` to extend folders for Page Builder pages.
- **File Manager Folders**: use `createFmFileFolderModelModifier` to extend folders for File Manager.

These plugins allow fine-grained control, such as targeting specific models.
