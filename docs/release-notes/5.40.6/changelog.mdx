## Admin App

### Fixed API Playground (GraphQL Playground) Tooltip Hiding Issue ([#4272](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4272))

Over the past month or so, we've received multiple reports of users experiencing issues with the API Playground (GraphQL Playground) tooltip. Specifically, once shown, the tooltip would not hide, making it much harder to interact with the API Playground.

<Image src={gqlTooltipsIssue} alt={"GraphQL Playground Tooltips Issue"} />

With this release, we've resolved this issue. Now, the tooltip will hide as expected, making it easier to interact with the API Playground. 

Note that the GraphQL Playground that's being used in the Admin app is a third-party library that is no longer actively maintained. Because of this, we're currently looking into possible alternatives that we could use in the future.

## Ported Changes From Recent 5.39 Patch Releases

With this release, weâ€™ve ported multiple changes from a set of 5.39 patch releases we've pushed recently. This was done to ensure that all the 5.39.x improvements are also available to projects that are using the 5.40.x version of Webiny.
