### Fixed an issue with republishing older revisions 

We've addressed an issue which would happen upon user trying to republish an older revision of a content entry. Instead of republishing the selected revision, the users would just be presented with the "Provided list of item keys contains duplicates" error message.

This issue has now been fixed and you can now republish older revisions without any issues.
