## Form Builder

### Fixed Backend Data Validation Issues ([#4567](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4567))

With the [5.42.0 release](/docs/release-notes/5.42.0/changelog), a regression was introduced that caused validation issues when saving changes in Form Builder's form editor and also using the Terms of Service feature. 

This issue has been fixed and you can now save changes in the Form Builder without any validation issues.

## Audit Logs

### Audit Logs Menu Item Now Visible in the Sidebar ([#4557](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4557))

Because of a mistake in the 5.42.0 release, the Audit Logs menu item was not visible in the sidebar for users that had this feature enabled.

This issue has been fixed and the Audit Logs menu item is now visible in the sidebar for users that have this feature enabled.
