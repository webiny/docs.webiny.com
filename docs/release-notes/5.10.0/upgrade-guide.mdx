- how to upgrade Webiny from 5.9.0 to 5.10.0

:::

:::danger
Before continuing, make sure to take the necessary precautions, listed in the [Overview](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny#-precaution-measures) section.
:::

:::info
Make sure to check out the [5.10.0 changelog](/docs/release-notes/5.10.0/changelog) to get familiar with all the changes introduced in this release.

## 1. Project Preparation

First, we need to prepare your project for the upgrade process.
We renamed our shared Elasticsearch package from `api-plugin-elastic-search-client` to `api-elasticsearch`, and we need to update package.json files that are using it, before attempting to upgrade packages using `yarn`.

In your project root, run the following:

```bash
npx https://gist.github.com/brunozoric/96e66c47abc6769947034fe707138cda
```

## 2. Upgrade Webiny Packages

We're now ready to upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages! Run the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.10.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.10.0`.

:::info
Before moving on, make sure you commit all your changes.
:::

## 3. Run the Upgrade Command

Now let's run the project upgrade:

```bash
yarn webiny upgrade 5.10.0
```

The upgrade script will make a couple of changes to your existing **API** project application's code (located within the `api` folder). Once the upgrade command has finished, you can run the [`git status`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) command to see all changes that the command performed.

## 4. Deploy Your Project

Finally, proceed by re-deploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```

:::caution
As stated in the [Overview](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny#pre-production-environments-first) section, we recommend that you first deploy your changes into one of your pre-production environments, like `dev` or `staging`.
