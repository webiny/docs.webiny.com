## Headless CMS

### Unpublishing Content Entries - Ensuring All Internal Records Are Correctly Updated ([#4137](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4137))

We've detected an issue where, upon unpublishing a content entry, an internal record was not correctly updated. This issue has now been resolved, and the internal records are now correctly updated when unpublishing content entries.

## Deployments

### Introducing the `WEBINY_MIGRATION_LOG_STREAMING` Environment Variable ([#4136](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4136) [#4139](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4139))

Upon deploying the **API** project application, users can now use the `WEBINY_MIGRATION_LOG_STREAMING` environment variable in order to decide whether they want the data migration-related logs to be streamed into the terminal or not, during the deployment process.

Note that, since the streaming of data migration logs is enabled by default, the `WEBINY_MIGRATION_LOG_STREAMING` variable is essentially only used when the user wants to disable the streaming of data migration logs.

To disable the streaming of data migration logs, set the `WEBINY_MIGRATION_LOG_STREAMING` environment variable to `false`:

```bash
WEBINY_MIGRATION_LOG_STREAMING=false webiny deploy api --env=dev
```

<Alert type="info">

  Regardless of the `WEBINY_MIGRATION_LOG_STREAMING` environment variable being used or not, the applicable data migrations will always be executed and all the data migration logs will still be available in the Amazon CloudWatch logs.
