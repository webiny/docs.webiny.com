## Headless CMS

### Unpublishing Content Entries - Ensuring All Internal Records Are Correctly Updated ([#4137](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4137))

We've detected an issue where, upon unpublishing a content entry, an internal record was not correctly updated. This issue has now been resolved, and the internal records are now correctly updated when unpublishing content entries.

### Brought Back `publishedOn` and `ownedBy` Entry Meta Fields (GraphQL Schema Level) ([#4156](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4156))

With the [5.39.0 release](/docs/release-notes/5.39.0/changelog), we've removed the following two content entry meta fields:

1. `publishedOn`
2. `ownedBy` 

These fields were removed because they were replaced with the [new meta fields](/docs/release-notes/5.39.0/changelog#headless-cms-revamped-date-time-and-identity-on-by-meta-fields). 

However, based on the user feedback, we've realized keeping these fields at least on the GraphQL schema level is helpful, as some users might still be using them in their existing applications (applications that are not yet updated to use the new meta fields).

So, in order to make things a bit easier, on the GraphQL schema level, we've decided to bring back these fields. 

<Image src={oldGqlFields} alt={<>Old <code>publishedOn</code> and <code>ownedBy</code> GraphQL Meta Fields Used In a GraphQL Query</>} />

Note that these fields are marked as **deprecated**, and, when possible, we recommend using the new meta fields instead. Also, as mentioned, these fields have only been brought back on the GraphQL schema level. Trying to access these fields via one of the JavaScript APIs will result in an error.

Ultimately, note that we plan to again remove these fields, with the 5.41.0 release. 

### Made New Meta Fields Nullable (GraphQL Schema Level) ([#4156](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4156))

On top of bringing back the `publishedOn` and `ownedBy` fields, again, on the GraphQL level, we've also changed the new **non-nullable** entry meta fields and make them nullable. To be specific, we're talking about the following eight fields:

1. `createdOn`
2. `savedOn`
3. `revisionCreatedOn`
4. `revisionSavedOn`
5. `createdBy`
6. `savedBy`
7. `createdByUser`
8. `savedByUser`

This change was made to ensure a better experience while performing the 5.39.x data migration. Without this change, while the data migration is being performed, in most cases, users with large data sets would be unable to use Headless CMS in the Admin app. This would happen simply because, while issuing GraphQL queries, the new meta fields would be required to be present, but, due to the data migration being in progress, these fields would not be present.

With this change, the new meta fields are now nullable, and, as a result, users can continue using Headless CMS in the Admin app, even while the data migration is in progress.

## Data Migrations

### Further Improving the 5.39.6-001 Data Migration ([#4154](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4154))

For this release, we've again invested some time in further improving the data migration that was introduced with the [5.39.6-001 release](/docs/release-notes/5.39.6/changelog#improving-the-5-39-0-meta-fields-data-migration-4115). 

The is because we've noticed that the data migration was simply taking too long to complete when large data sets were involved. So, we've now implemented multiple performance improvements.

As a result, the data migration should now be significantly faster. In some cases, the data migration time has been reduced even by 10 times.

Note that the improved data migration is not automatically executed, and that, by default, the migration will still be executed as it was before. If you want to execute the new optimized migration, there will be a couple of manual steps involved. For more information, please take a look at the linked GitHub [pull request](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4154).

### Introducing the `WEBINY_MIGRATION_LOG_STREAMING` Environment Variable ([#4136](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4136) [#4139](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4139))

Upon deploying the **API** project application, users can now use the `WEBINY_MIGRATION_LOG_STREAMING` environment variable in order to decide whether they want the data migration-related logs to be streamed into the terminal or not, during the deployment process.

Note that, since the streaming of data migration logs is enabled by default, the `WEBINY_MIGRATION_LOG_STREAMING` variable is essentially only used when the user wants to disable the streaming of data migration logs.

To disable the streaming of data migration logs, set the `WEBINY_MIGRATION_LOG_STREAMING` environment variable to `false`:

```bash
WEBINY_MIGRATION_LOG_STREAMING=false webiny deploy api --env=dev
```

<Alert type="info">

  Regardless of the `WEBINY_MIGRATION_LOG_STREAMING` environment variable being used or not, the applicable data migrations will always be executed and all the data migration logs will still be available in the Amazon CloudWatch logs.

## Page Builder

### Website Settings Form - Fixed an Issue Related to Locale Switching ([#4157](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4157))

In case a user switched to a different locale, submitting Page Builder's Website settings form would result in an error. This issue has now been resolved, and the Website settings form now works as expected, regardless of the locale being used.
