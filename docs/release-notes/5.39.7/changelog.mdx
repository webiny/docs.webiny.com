### Introducing the `--data-migration-reporter` Flag

Upon deploying the **API** project application, via the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/core-development-concepts/basics/project-deployment) command, users can now use the `--data-migration-reporter` flag in order to decide whether they want to see the data migration-related logs in the terminal or not, while the deployment is in progress.

Note that passing the `--data-migration-reporter` flag doesn't change the already existing behavior of the `webiny deploy` command because the default value of the flag *is* set to `true`. The flag only allows users to potentially avoid the data migration logs being printed in the terminal, by passing `--no-data-migration-reporter`.

<Alert type="info">

  Regardless of the flag being used, the pending data migrations will still be executed and all the logs will still be available in the Amazon CloudWatch logs.
