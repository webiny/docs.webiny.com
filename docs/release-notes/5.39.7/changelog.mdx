### Unpublishing Content Entries - Ensuring All Internal Records Are Correctly Updated ([#4137](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4137))

We've detected an issue where, upon unpublishing a content entry, an internal record was not correctly updated. This issue has now been resolved, and the internal records are now correctly updated when unpublishing content entries.

## Deployments

### Introducing the `--data-migration-reporter` Flag ([#4136](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/4136))

Upon deploying the **API** project application, via the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/core-development-concepts/basics/project-deployment) command, users can now use the `--data-migration-reporter` flag in order to decide whether they want to see the data migration-related logs in the terminal or not, while the deployment is in progress.

Note that passing the `--data-migration-reporter` flag doesn't change the already existing behavior of the `webiny deploy` command because the default value of the flag *is* set to `true`. The flag only allows users to potentially avoid the data migration logs being printed in the terminal, by passing `--no-data-migration-reporter`.

<Alert type="info">

  Regardless of the flag being used, the pending data migrations will still be executed and all the logs will still be available in the Amazon CloudWatch logs.
