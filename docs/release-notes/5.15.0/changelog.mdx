# Changes

This document highlights the most important fixes, improvements, and features, that were introduced in Webiny `5.15.0`.

<Alert type="info" title="How To Upgrade?">

Please check the [Webiny 5.15.0 migration guide](/docs/{version}/release-notes/5.15.0/upgrade-guide) for the upgrade steps.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

The majority of changes that were introduced in this release are related to the [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)-only version of Webiny.

</Alert>

<Alert type="success" title="Amazon DynamoDB-only version of Webiny">

[In case you missed it](/docs/{version}/architecture/api/overview), at the moment, Webiny relies on both [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) and [Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/the-elk-stack/what-is-elasticsearch/) databases in order to store and retrieve data. And while this is definitely a good choice for larger projects, for smaller and mid-sized projects, we'll be introducing an Amazon DynamoDB-only version of Webiny. For now there are no official estimates when this will be available, but we can definitely say that a very large amount of work has already been done.

## Page Builder

### Storage Operations ([#1872](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1872))

We extracted existing DynamoDB + Elasticsearch storage logic into [`@webiny/api-page-builder-so-ddb-es`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/next/packages/api-page-builder-so-ddb-es) package.
This allows us to create package that stores the data into DynamoDB only, or some other database.

We moved `SearchPagesPlugin`, `SearchLatestPagesPlugin` and `SearchPublishedPages` from [`@webiny/api-page-builder`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/next/packages/api-page-builder) to [`@webiny/api-page-builder-so-ddb-es`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/next/packages/api-page-builder-so-ddb-es).

### GraphQL

##### Common changes

- `sort` is now a list of strings and default sort is `createdOn_DESC` - you can check out the schema to see the fields you can sort by

##### Changes In Pages Schema:

- query `listPublishedPages` `page` argument is changed to `after` - pass the `meta.cursor` value to `after` to paginate
- `meta` output was changed to be the same as in other apps

```graphql
meta {
	hasMorePages: Boolean!
	totalCount: Number!
	cursor: String
}

```

##### Changes In Menu Schema:

- the type `PbMenu` `items` input and output are an array of JSON objects

### Prerendering

We extracted prerendering logic into separate file, [`@webiny/api-page-builder/prerendering`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/next/packages/api-page-builder/src/prerendering), so it is now imported into [`api/code/graphql/src/index.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/api/code/graphql/src/index.ts#L11) file. If you do not want to use prerendering of pages, feel free to remove the referenced import statement.

## Elasticsearch

### Query Modifier Plugin ([#1872](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1872))

Due to changes in the way of how query building for Elasticsearch works we changed `ElasticsearchQueryModifierPlugin` in the [`@webiny/api-elasticsearch`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/next/packages/api-elasticsearch) package.
It is an abstract class now, so if you used it to modify the query, please change it to either `PageElasticsearchQueryModifierPlugin` for [`@webiny/api-page-builder`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/next/packages/api-page-builder) or `FileElasticsearchQueryModifierPlugin` for [`@webiny/api-file-manager`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/next/packages/api-file-manager).
Also, in that abstract class, method named `apply` was renamed to `modifyQuery`.

### Body And Sort Modifier Plugins ([#1872](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1872))

There are new `ElasticsearchBodyModifierPlugin` and `ElasticsearchSortModifierPlugin` abstract classes, which are extended in each of the application that uses Elasticsearch. As their name suggests, they are specialized to modify either body or sort parameters of the Elasticsearch query.

For Page Builder check out `PageElasticsearchBodyModifierPlugin` and `PageElasticsearchSortModifierPlugin` classes.

For File Manager check out `FileElasticsearchBodyModifierPlugin` and `FileElasticsearchSortModifierPlugin` classes.

## Headless CMS

### Reference Field - Fixed Order of Entries ([#1922](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1922), [@nelsonchen5](https://github.com/nelsonchen5))

When consuming content via the **read** Headless CMS GraphQL API, the reference fields that might have been included in the GraphQL query would return entries in an incorrect order. From now on, this is no longer the case.

A special shout out to [@nelsonchen5](https://github.com/nelsonchen5) for sorting this out! ❤️

<Alert type="success">

</Alert>

### `ElasticsearchFieldPlugin` Class Not Used Anymore ([#1872](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1872))

The definition of Elasticsearch field now uses `CmsEntryElasticsearchFieldPlugin` class instead of `ElasticsearchFieldPlugin`.

## File Manager ([#1912](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1912))

### GraphQL

Fixed a bug with missing `where` parameter in the `listFiles` query. Also added the `tag_and_in` option to where so users can search for files that contain all given tags.

Also note that `types`, `tags`, `ids` and `search` parameters in `listFiles` query are deprecated. Use the `where` parameter instead.

## Development

### Webiny CLI - `--help` Argument Now Works as Expected ([#1926](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1926), [@snstanton](https://github.com/snstanton))

When using the Webiny CLI, the `--help` argument now works as expected.

Special thanks to [@snstanton](https://github.com/snstanton) for taking care of this! ️️❤️
