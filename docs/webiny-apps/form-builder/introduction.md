Form Builder is a Webiny app that lets you create dynamic and rich forms
with ease, with just a few clicks from a simple UI inside of the Webiny
Admin.

Once created, you can easily show your forms on your web site
using a provided React component or even better, embed the form any way you
like into your pages built with [Webiny Page Builder](/docs/webiny-apps/page-builder/introduction).

Last but not least, the app also lets you review all of the received form submissions,
check out conversion rates, create CSV exports, define additional behaviour on successful form submissions via triggers, and more.

In the following section we will cover everything you need to know in order to get started with the Form Builder app.

> If you are a developer and want to learn how to introduce additional customizations to your forms, feel free to check out the [Development](/docs/webiny-apps/form-builder/react-component) section.
