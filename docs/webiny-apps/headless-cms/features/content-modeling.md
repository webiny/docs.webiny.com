Did you set up your Webiny account? If yes, make sure you have `Headless cms` enabled, if not then follow the [quick start](get-started/quick-start.md).

To get hands-on the `Headless CMS` features, you can start by creating a content model.

Webiny features a menu component that is extended via the content models from the Headless CMS.
This allows you to build great backend experience for your team, making it easy and intuitive for them to find exactly the content they are looking for.

You can navigate to **Headless CMS > Content Models Menu > Models || [Groups](/docs/webiny-apps/headless-cms/features/content-modeling-groups)**

**What is the content model?**

> A content model is a formal representation of how your content will be structured. Define the content fields and the relationships between other content models.

Webiny offers you powerful modeling features that allow you to model the content. You can define relationships using a simple drag&drop editor as  seen in the image below:

Content Model Fields enable you to define the fundamental characteristics of information.

Start from the project requirements and arrange the content flow as you need based on the design and function.
